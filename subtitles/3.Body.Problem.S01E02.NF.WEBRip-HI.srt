I do. [exhales]

00:01:03,563 --> 00:01:04,731
It's bullshit.

Bullshit?

00:01:06,316 --> 00:01:07,650
It never happened.

None of the satellites saw it.
You know why?

19
00:01:21,247 --> 00:01:23,708
- Why?
- Because it never happened.

20
00:01:23,792 --> 00:01:25,126
It was a deepfake.

There are a hundred billion

145
00:10:11,027 --> 00:10:18,027
43 plus 8 equals 51.
A difference of 13 minutes.

I simplified the math for you.

147
00:10:25,708 --> 00:10:29,086
The Sun reflected
the radio waves from Jupiter?

148

Not just reflected. It <i>amplified</i> them.

149
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:37,595
The signal from the Sun was millions of
times stronger than the one from Jupiter.

150

So we can use the Sun as a super-antenna?

00:10:44,727 --> 00:10:45,728

Imagine our great Red Sun, our Chairman,

180
00:12:37,423 --> 00:12:39,704
amplifying the words of the People,
a hundred millionfold.

181
00:12:39,967 --> 00:12:42,094
Absolutely not. I forbid it.

182
00:12:42,178 --> 00:12:44,680
This could get us all executed.

183
00:12:44,764 --> 00:12:48,893
- [Lei Zhicheng lecturing indistinctly]
- [somber instrumental music playing]

184
00:12:54,982 --> 00:12:57,693
[somber music fades slowly]

185
00:12:58,110 --> 00:12:59,987
Test transmission in sixty seconds.

186
00:13:04,408 --> 00:13:07,369
[fly buzzing]

187
00:13:14,376 --> 00:13:16,212
[Ye Wenjie breathing shakily]

188
00:13:18,756 --> 00:13:20,007
[buttons clacking]

189
00:13:20,090 --> 00:13:21,717
[tense music playing]

190
00:13:21,801 --> 00:13:24,470
[resolute instrumental music playing]

191
00:13:38,567 --> 00:13:40,569
[satellite dish groaning]

192
00:13:47,409 --> 00:13:49,411
[engineer]
Test transmission in thirty seconds.

193
00:14:05,678 --> 00:14:07,805
[fly buzzing]

194
00:14:14,061 --> 00:14:16,772
Test transmission in ten.

195
00:14:17,022 --> 00:14:17,857
Nine.

196
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:18,940
Eight.

197
00:14:18,983 --> 00:14:19,859
Seven.

198
00:14:19,942 --> 00:14:20,776
Six.

199
00:14:20,943 --> 00:14:21,819
Five.

200
00:14:21,902 --> 00:14:22,736
Four.

201
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:23,820
Three.

202
00:14:23,904 --> 00:14:24,738
Two.

203
00:14:24,822 --> 00:14:25,656
One.

204
00:14:25,739 --> 00:14:26,949
Begin test transmission.

205
00:14:30,411 --> 00:14:32,413
[music building]

206
00:14:36,458 --> 00:14:37,626
[loud thud]

207
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:39,795
- [fly buzzing]
- [chuckles]

208
00:14:42,464 --> 00:14:44,300
[engineer] Message sent.

209
00:14:44,383 --> 00:14:46,176
Test transmission complete.

210
00:14:47,177 --> 00:14:50,514
[dramatic orchestral music playing]

211
00:15:07,072 --> 00:15:09,074
[birds calling]

212
00:15:12,828 --> 00:15:14,872
[in English] What do you know
about this man?

213
00:15:18,334 --> 00:15:20,044
[Auggie] He was at Vera's funeral.

214
00:15:20,127 --> 00:15:21,587
Mike Evans.

215
00:15:21,670 --> 00:15:25,549
Owns Evans Energy, the biggest
privately held oil company on the planet.

216
00:15:25,633 --> 00:15:29,720
Now, does it surprise you
that Vera had a friend like that?

217
00:15:29,803 --> 00:15:31,805
Nothing surprises me anymore.

218
00:15:33,599 --> 00:15:35,100
You know what surprises me?

219
00:15:40,481 --> 00:15:42,524
This woman you say you spoke to.

220
00:15:43,651 --> 00:15:45,945
Here's security footage
of the alley you were in.

221
00:15:46,528 --> 00:15:47,529
There you are.

222
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:49,406
All alone,

223
00:15:50,449 --> 00:15:51,700
talking to no one.

224
00:15:51,784 --> 00:15:53,827
No. No, she was there.

225
00:15:53,911 --> 00:15:56,431
- Doesn't look like it, does it?
- I swear to God she was there.

226
00:15:56,497 --> 00:15:57,790
I wasn't talking to myself.

227
00:15:57,873 --> 00:15:59,875
I believe you. Look.

228
00:16:03,629 --> 00:16:06,507
Your cigarette's unlit, and...

229
00:16:10,052 --> 00:16:11,553
Your cigarette's lit.

230
00:16:12,096 --> 00:16:14,765
You didn't light it yourself.
Your lighter doesn't work.

231
00:16:16,141 --> 00:16:20,312
Now, I don't know how, but someone
scrubbed her out of the footage.

232
00:16:20,813 --> 00:16:23,273
My team couldn't find
any trace of it being manipulated

233
00:16:23,357 --> 00:16:27,236
but we know it was,
which is fucking... pretty weird.

234
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:32,116
Not as weird as the stars
turning on and off, but weird.

235
00:16:33,075 --> 00:16:35,327
Why did they wanna shut down your lab?

236
00:16:36,245 --> 00:16:37,079
I don't know.

237
00:16:37,162 --> 00:16:39,331
Well, you must be someone important.

238
00:16:39,415 --> 00:16:40,290
I'm not important.

239
00:16:40,374 --> 00:16:42,960
Well, you just invented
the world's finest nanofiber,

240
00:16:43,043 --> 00:16:45,337
3,000 times finer than human hair,

241
00:16:45,421 --> 00:16:48,382
invisible as air,
as strong as steel, all that shit.

242
00:16:48,465 --> 00:16:49,675
All that shit.

243
00:16:49,758 --> 00:16:52,886
Well, it's obviously dangerous to someone.

244
00:16:52,970 --> 00:16:54,221
Competitor, maybe.

245
00:16:54,304 --> 00:16:57,182
Yeah, a competitor
who made the universe flicker.

246
00:16:59,810 --> 00:17:01,353
Were you close to Vera Ye?

247
00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:06,275
I used to be.

248
00:17:07,317 --> 00:17:09,111
Smartest person I've ever met.

249
00:17:10,779 --> 00:17:12,031
Then I think I disappointed her

250
00:17:12,114 --> 00:17:14,700
'cause I quit her course
and switched into applied science.

251
00:17:15,617 --> 00:17:17,786
Maybe that's why she killed herself.

252
00:17:19,621 --> 00:17:21,582
This countdown you saw,

253
00:17:23,292 --> 00:17:26,503
it disappeared as soon as
you stopped your work, right?

254
00:17:27,254 --> 00:17:28,964
Has anyone else seen it?

255
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:29,923
They have.

256
00:17:30,007 --> 00:17:32,342
A cybernetics professor in New Delhi.

257
00:17:32,426 --> 00:17:35,721
An AI scientist at Boston Dynamics.

258
00:17:35,804 --> 00:17:37,973
A physicist in London just the other day.

259
00:17:38,057 --> 00:17:39,308
Couple of dozen more.

260
00:17:40,434 --> 00:17:41,769
What happened to them?

261
00:17:43,771 --> 00:17:44,980
They quit working.

262
00:17:45,064 --> 00:17:46,857
[unsettling music plays softly]

263
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:48,692
Either they quit like you,

264
00:17:49,943 --> 00:17:51,612
or they quit like Vera Ye.

265
00:17:55,407 --> 00:17:57,659
[Jin on phone] <i>Hey.
You said you were gonna call.</i>

266
00:17:58,327 --> 00:18:01,038
<i>You okay? Hope so.</i>

267
00:18:01,121 --> 00:18:02,247
[music fades out]

268
00:18:02,331 --> 00:18:03,457
[sighs]

269
00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:04,917
'Kay. Bye.

270
00:18:11,173 --> 00:18:12,257
[exhales]

271
00:18:15,094 --> 00:18:16,261
[sighs]

272
00:18:21,266 --> 00:18:23,268
[menacing instrumental music playing]

273
00:18:42,287 --> 00:18:44,331
[Jin exhales]

274
00:18:44,414 --> 00:18:45,332
[woman] <i>Level one.</i>

275
00:18:45,415 --> 00:18:46,667
[exhales softly]

276
00:18:47,668 --> 00:18:48,544
[gull crying]

277
00:18:48,627 --> 00:18:49,878
[Jin] This is insane.

278
00:18:52,131 --> 00:18:53,882
[icy wind gusting]

279
00:18:55,259 --> 00:18:57,261
[footsteps approaching]

280
00:19:07,688 --> 00:19:09,898
- I am the Count of the West.
- [Jin chuckles]

281
00:19:10,941 --> 00:19:11,941
Whoa.

282
00:19:14,695 --> 00:19:15,695
Oh wow.

283
00:19:19,741 --> 00:19:20,741
Very cool.

284
00:19:21,910 --> 00:19:22,744
- [gasps]
- Whoa!

285
00:19:22,828 --> 00:19:25,122
How dare you touch a man of royal blood?

286
00:19:25,205 --> 00:19:28,333
[chuckles] Sorry. I just didn't know
you were, um...

287
00:19:28,417 --> 00:19:30,460
Are you real? Like, another player?

288
00:19:31,211 --> 00:19:32,211
Or no?

289
00:19:32,254 --> 00:19:34,006
You're an AI.

290
00:19:34,089 --> 00:19:35,632
I am the Count of the West.

291
00:19:35,716 --> 00:19:37,593
So, a character in the game, then.

292
00:19:37,676 --> 00:19:39,720
[Count] Enough talk of games!
This is no game.

293
00:19:41,138 --> 00:19:42,138
This is my follower.

294
00:19:43,056 --> 00:19:45,475
You may call her Follower.

295
00:19:46,602 --> 00:19:47,686
[Jin] I'm Jin Cheng.

296
00:19:47,769 --> 00:19:50,230
Please, choose a better name.

297
00:19:50,314 --> 00:19:52,232
- Oh.
- [Count] One befitting a hero.

298
00:19:52,316 --> 00:19:54,526
For we hope you will be ours.

299
00:19:55,319 --> 00:19:56,653
Uh-huh.

300
00:19:56,737 --> 00:19:59,656
Your mission is to solve
the riddle of this world.

301
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:02,117
[Jin] Riddle of this world?

302
00:20:02,868 --> 00:20:04,453
All right. How about, uh...

303
00:20:06,747 --> 00:20:07,747
Copernicus.

304
00:20:09,708 --> 00:20:14,087
Welcome to Civilization 137, Copernicus.

305
00:20:15,672 --> 00:20:16,548
Hey...

306
00:20:16,632 --> 00:20:17,799
[sighs]

307
00:20:18,967 --> 00:20:20,302
Where are we going?

308
00:20:20,385 --> 00:20:23,263
We're going to the pyramid
to see Emperor Zhou.

309
00:20:23,764 --> 00:20:25,265
This is a chaotic era.

310
00:20:25,349 --> 00:20:26,350
[Jin] A chaotic era?

311
00:20:26,433 --> 00:20:30,562
[Count] Except for stable eras,
all times are chaotic eras.

312
00:20:31,146 --> 00:20:32,648
When a new era arrives,

313
00:20:32,731 --> 00:20:36,318
the Emperor consults great minds
about the movements of the sun.

314
00:20:37,069 --> 00:20:38,987
This is a weird fucking game.

315
00:20:39,947 --> 00:20:43,659
You must decide
whether an era is chaotic or stable.

316
00:20:44,493 --> 00:20:48,747
If Emperor Zhou is wrong,
an entire civilization will be destroyed.

317
00:20:48,830 --> 00:20:50,457
What? How?

318
00:20:54,795 --> 00:20:55,795
[Count] Like this.

319
00:20:56,588 --> 00:20:58,048
[sun sizzling]

320
00:20:58,131 --> 00:21:00,342
[wind picks up]

321
00:21:00,968 --> 00:21:01,969
[Count] Run!

322
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:04,429
Hurry!

323
00:21:04,513 --> 00:21:06,515
[dramatic orchestral music playing]

324
00:21:08,642 --> 00:21:10,394
[ice crackling]

325
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,656
[Jin] Hey, don't push her.

326
00:21:22,739 --> 00:21:24,866
There's only enough shade for two of us.

327
00:21:25,617 --> 00:21:26,618
Count.

328
00:21:26,702 --> 00:21:29,746
[Count] Well, it can't be me.
I must get my prediction to the Emperor.

329
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:32,040
- You won't abandon me, will you?
- Go.

330
00:21:38,547 --> 00:21:40,549
[Jin] It's too hot. She's gonna burn up.

331
00:21:41,049 --> 00:21:42,259
[Count] No, she won't.

332
00:21:48,682 --> 00:21:51,268
- [flesh writhing]
- [bones creaking]

333
00:21:54,271 --> 00:21:55,605
[Jin groans]

334
00:22:02,404 --> 00:22:04,406
[music fades]

335
00:22:27,846 --> 00:22:29,014
Is she dead?

336
00:22:29,097 --> 00:22:30,097
[Count] No.

337
00:22:32,517 --> 00:22:35,604
Those who dehydrate fast enough
can be preserved.

338
00:22:35,687 --> 00:22:38,565
We rehydrate them
when a stable era arrives.

339
00:22:40,275 --> 00:22:42,944
So, this is how people
survive the chaotic eras?

340
00:22:43,945 --> 00:22:46,698
If one of us survives, we all survive.

341
00:22:46,782 --> 00:22:48,950
[tender string music playing]

342
00:22:50,327 --> 00:22:52,329
Count? Count!

343
00:22:52,412 --> 00:22:54,081
What do I do with her?

344
00:22:54,581 --> 00:22:55,582
Count!

345
00:23:00,170 --> 00:23:02,589
[string music building]

346
00:23:13,975 --> 00:23:15,185
[Jin sighs]

347
00:23:17,979 --> 00:23:21,733
[woman 1] Well, if science can't explain
the blinking stars, why can't it be God?

348
00:23:21,817 --> 00:23:23,360
Why would He be so subtle about it?

349
00:23:23,443 --> 00:23:26,279
In the Bible, He sent down
angels of death with flaming swords.

350
00:23:26,363 --> 00:23:29,324
He sent she-bears to maul children
who fucked with His prophets.

351
00:23:29,408 --> 00:23:32,327
Now He's blinking stars
to show some kind of stupid code?

352
00:23:32,411 --> 00:23:34,472
- What? Does that sound like God to you?
- [laughter]

353
00:23:34,496 --> 00:23:36,176
[woman 2] Who else can make stars flicker?

354
00:23:36,206 --> 00:23:38,643
- [Saul] No one can do that.
- [woman 1] So, how did it happen?

355
00:23:38,667 --> 00:23:39,501
[Saul] I don't know.

356
00:23:39,584 --> 00:23:43,130
But if science tells you that something's
impossible, and it happens anyway,

357
00:23:43,213 --> 00:23:44,506
it means one of two things.

358
00:23:44,589 --> 00:23:45,424

not even a fucking charging port.

There always is.

So? What's our mission?

412

Our mission, Jin Cheng,

413
00:26:29,796 --> 00:26:34,092
is Jack fucking Rooney

That's good news. [chuckles] Right?

00:27:39,699 --> 00:27:41,910
- I shut down the project.
- What?

430
00:27:41,993 --> 00:27:44,371
She told me if I stopped working
the countdown would stop.

431

I stopped, and she was right.

I mean, of course they want to fire me.

No, no. Don't tell me.

538
00:34:33,654 --> 00:34:37,533
After ten years you finally asked Jin out,
now that she's dating an admiral.

539
00:34:37,617 --> 00:34:39,577
I have pancreatic cancer.

540
00:34:41,245 --> 00:34:42,288
Stage four.

541
00:34:45,583 --> 00:34:47,001
It's spread all over.

542
00:34:48,586 --> 00:34:50,088
Liver, lungs.

543
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:54,842
Median survival time is, uh...

544
00:34:54,926 --> 00:34:58,554
It's, like, two to six months, so...

545
00:35:01,641 --> 00:35:02,642
There it is.

546
00:35:03,351 --> 00:35:04,352
[quietly] Fuck that.

547
00:35:05,353 --> 00:35:06,353
What?

548
00:35:06,771 --> 00:35:09,899
Some NHS doctor says so,
and you're just gonna accept it?

549
00:35:09,982 --> 00:35:10,982
No.

550
00:35:11,609 --> 00:35:13,402
No, no, no. No, no. Fuck that.

551
00:35:13,486 --> 00:35:15,488
We'll... We'll go to Switzerland.

552
00:35:15,571 --> 00:35:19,408
- Or New York, or somewhere fucking good.
- No, Jack. I'm too far gone, mate.

553
00:35:20,701 --> 00:35:23,538
All they can do now is
to make me comfortable. All right?

554
00:35:23,621 --> 00:35:25,873
So they're gonna operate
on my tumors, that's...

555
00:35:25,957 --> 00:35:29,710
They're gonna... fluff the pillows
on the sinking ship.

556
00:35:29,794 --> 00:35:31,212
And I said,

557
00:35:32,588 --> 00:35:33,881
"Fuck that, pal."

558
00:35:35,633 --> 00:35:37,969
- My money says they're wrong.
- Come on, Jack.

559
00:35:38,052 --> 00:35:39,595
You fucking come on.

560
00:35:41,597 --> 00:35:44,851
This is what you always do, man.
You... You give up on everything...

561
00:35:44,934 --> 00:35:46,018
I didn't give up...

562
00:35:46,102 --> 00:35:48,312
You quit physics,
thought you weren't smart enough.

563
00:35:48,396 --> 00:35:51,107
You gave up on Jin because
you thought you were punching above.

564
00:35:53,526 --> 00:35:57,029
You're not giving up
on your own fucking life. [sniffles]

565
00:36:00,533 --> 00:36:01,659
Fuck that.

566
00:36:07,790 --> 00:36:08,624
Eat.

567
00:36:08,708 --> 00:36:09,750
[sighs]

568
00:36:10,459 --> 00:36:14,005
- I don't feel like eating, Jack.
- Will. Just...

569
00:36:16,799 --> 00:36:18,009
Try.

570
00:36:25,850 --> 00:36:27,852
[tense music playing]

571
00:36:33,065 --> 00:36:35,943
[ominous orchestral music playing]

572
00:37:04,764 --> 00:37:08,726
[Count] If I may, Emperor Zhou,
the sun is Yang.

573
00:37:09,518 --> 00:37:11,812
The night is Yin.

574
00:37:14,065 --> 00:37:17,193
Presently we are caught
in the chaos of imbalance.

575
00:37:18,069 --> 00:37:20,529
But we shall be no longer.

576
00:37:20,613 --> 00:37:22,907
I bring you salvation
for our civilization...

577
00:37:22,990 --> 00:37:24,742
[Zhou] Yes. Yes, get on with it.

578
00:37:25,284 --> 00:37:28,079
I have created a code for the universe.

579
00:37:28,162 --> 00:37:31,457
And with this code,
I can predict the movements of the sun.

580
00:37:32,041 --> 00:37:33,751
That's what they all say.

581
00:37:39,966 --> 00:37:41,968
[tense, rhythmic music playing]

582
00:37:47,598 --> 00:37:50,685
I hope your prediction can save us,
for your sake.

583
00:37:50,768 --> 00:37:53,271
- This is prophecy, not prediction.
- [Zhou] What?

584
00:37:54,146 --> 00:37:56,691
Speak aloud, child, or die.

585
00:37:56,774 --> 00:37:57,774
[clears throat]

586
00:38:01,612 --> 00:38:04,782
Emperor. This is the <i>I Ching.</i>

587
00:38:05,324 --> 00:38:07,952
It's beautiful, but it's not scientific.

588
00:38:08,035 --> 00:38:08,911
Explain.

589
00:38:08,995 --> 00:38:10,835
[Jin] I don't think
it will solve your problem.

590
00:38:10,871 --> 00:38:13,582
It's divination.
It doesn't follow any physical laws.

591
00:38:14,542 --> 00:38:16,585
Physical laws?

592
00:38:16,669 --> 00:38:18,546
Yeah. The laws of physics.

593
00:38:20,339 --> 00:38:23,134
Everything we've observed
to be true about the world.

594
00:38:24,719 --> 00:38:26,178
Which world?

595
00:38:26,762 --> 00:38:28,681
[Count] Your Imperial Majesty.

596
00:38:31,142 --> 00:38:34,645
The code is complete.
It will answer your questions.

597
00:38:34,729 --> 00:38:35,729
[Zhou] Very well.

598
00:38:36,188 --> 00:38:38,983
When will it be safe
to rehydrate the masses?

599
00:38:42,194 --> 00:38:44,196
[sizzling]

600
00:38:56,125 --> 00:38:59,086
The chaotic era
will last another eight days.

601
00:38:59,170 --> 00:39:04,800
And when it is over, we will enjoy
a glorious stable era for 63 years

602
00:39:05,384 --> 00:39:09,138
with a climate so mild,
it will be a golden age.

603
00:39:09,221 --> 00:39:10,848
Sky. Now.

604
00:39:15,353 --> 00:39:17,646
Let the days fly past.

605
00:39:22,193 --> 00:39:24,236
Let the days fly past.

606
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:25,529
[Jin] Hmm?

607
00:39:26,030 --> 00:39:28,783
Put your hand on the ground.
It speeds up time.

608
00:39:32,370 --> 00:39:33,829
[dramatic orchestral music playing]

609
00:39:33,913 --> 00:39:34,913
[Jin gasps]

610
00:39:55,851 --> 00:39:57,061
There!

611
00:39:57,144 --> 00:39:59,647
Stability for 63 years.

612
00:40:00,439 --> 00:40:02,191
- Is it possible?
- It is, Emperor.

613
00:40:03,984 --> 00:40:07,196
I advise you to awaken your dynasty
and let it prosper.

614
00:40:08,906 --> 00:40:11,534
Rehydrate!

615
00:40:47,027 --> 00:40:49,029
[bright instrumental music playing]

616
00:41:20,644 --> 00:41:22,646

617
00:41:30,905 --> 00:41:33,032
[laughing]

618
00:41:43,626 --> 00:41:45,044
[Jin inhales sharply]

619
00:41:50,257 --> 00:41:52,301
[uplifting orchestral music playing]

620
00:41:53,677 --> 00:41:55,095
[Follower gasps]

621
00:41:55,179 --> 00:41:56,180
[exhales]

622
00:42:02,311 --> 00:42:03,854
You didn't abandon me.

623
00:42:03,938 --> 00:42:05,231
Of course not.

624
00:42:14,031 --> 00:42:16,033
[wind picks up]

625
00:42:18,827 --> 00:42:19,870
[Jin gasps]

626
00:42:20,454 --> 00:42:22,581
Count! Look!

627
00:42:23,499 --> 00:42:25,417
[Zhou] No.

628
00:42:27,461 --> 00:42:29,922
[ominous string music playing]

629
00:42:32,258 --> 00:42:34,260

[all screaming]

631
00:42:50,359 --> 00:42:51,652
[Follower] Copernicus!

632
00:42:52,194 --> 00:42:53,862
Copernicus, please!

633
00:42:53,946 --> 00:42:55,489
[wind whistling]

634
00:42:55,573 --> 00:42:57,616

[Jin groans]

638

[Follower] Please, Copernicus!

[Jin grunting]

640
00:43:16,468 --> 00:43:18,012

[Follower] Save me!

643
00:43:25,311 --> 00:43:26,937
Please!

644
00:43:28,230 --> 00:43:29,940
Save me!

645
00:43:32,192 --> 00:43:34,653

- [icy shards splintering]

[somber instrumental music playing]

651
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:25,579
Civilization number 137
was obliterated by extreme cold.

652
00:44:26,789 --> 00:44:28,332
You did not save them.

653
00:44:28,832 --> 00:44:33,003
But you did establish the superiority
of science over mysticism.

654
00:44:33,754 --> 00:44:38,217
In level two, you must use science
to save the next civilization.

655
00:44:40,260 --> 00:44:41,637
[Jin gasps]

656
00:44:41,720 --> 00:44:44,807

[door opens]

660
00:45:39,778 --> 00:45:42,197
I received a complaint about you,
Clarence.

661
00:45:42,281 --> 00:45:43,699
What did I do now?

662
00:45:43,782 --> 00:45:45,826
Apparently you've been smoking
in your office.

663
00:45:47,077 --> 00:45:49,955
Yeah, I'd go outside, but it's a long way.

664
00:45:53,083 --> 00:45:54,293
I'll go outside next time.

665
00:45:54,376 --> 00:45:57,254
No need. I sacked the guy
who made the complaint.

666
00:45:57,838 --> 00:46:01,091
If he's worrying about you,
he's not worrying about our adversaries.

667
00:46:01,175 --> 00:46:02,843
Well, I wish you hadn't fired him.

668
00:46:03,469 --> 00:46:04,762
Tell me about Evans.

669
00:46:06,013 --> 00:46:07,222
[Clarence sighs]

670
00:46:07,848 --> 00:46:10,100
Turns out he likes paying for things.

671
00:46:10,601 --> 00:46:14,062
Anti-vax propaganda,
5G conspiracy theories,

672
00:46:14,146 --> 00:46:16,774
anti-science politicians around the world.

673
00:46:17,566 --> 00:46:20,360
I'd bet money
he's behind all the rest of it too.

674
00:46:20,861 --> 00:46:23,530
What about the stars?
Did he pay for them to disappear?

675
00:46:23,614 --> 00:46:26,617
There's someone behind everything.
You just have to dig.

676
00:46:27,159 --> 00:46:29,661
Well, I dug up this.

677
00:46:31,371 --> 00:46:35,083
I was reading up on radio telescopes
after the stars blinked.

678
00:46:35,167 --> 00:46:41,173
Back in 1977, Ohio State University
detected a 72-second sequence.

679
00:46:41,965 --> 00:46:44,092
They called it the Wow! signal

680
00:46:44,176 --> 00:46:47,763
because it made
all the astrophysicists go, "Wow!"

681
00:46:47,846 --> 00:46:50,641
They said it looked like
an attempt at communication.

682
00:46:50,724 --> 00:46:52,100
Attempt from who?

683
00:46:52,810 --> 00:46:54,269
Little green men.

684
00:46:55,813 --> 00:46:56,813
What's it say?

685
00:46:56,855 --> 00:46:58,065
No one knows.

686
00:46:58,148 --> 00:47:00,192
No one's been able to decode it,

687
00:47:00,275 --> 00:47:03,153
and nobody outside of Ohio State
detected it.

688
00:47:06,406 --> 00:47:09,326
Except for one observatory
in Northeast China.

689
00:47:10,953 --> 00:47:11,954
And?

690
00:47:13,163 --> 00:47:15,040
Well, it's probably nothing.

691
00:47:15,123 --> 00:47:16,208
[sniffles]

692
00:47:17,125 --> 00:47:18,210
[sighs]

693
00:47:19,670 --> 00:47:21,797
Funny thing about Mike Evans.

694
00:47:24,383 --> 00:47:26,969
Guess where he lived in 1977?

[man, in Mandarin] No coffee,

698
00:48:29,865 --> 00:48:31,742
sorry.

699
00:48:32,910 --> 00:48:33,910
No coffee,

701
00:48:40,709 --> 00:48:43,712
[in English] May I ask why you are here?

702
00:48:46,465 --> 00:48:48,425
I'm trying to save lives.

703
00:48:48,508 --> 00:48:49,635
The locals?

704
00:48:49,718 --> 00:48:51,845
- [scoffs]
- [Ye Wenjie] How are you helping...

705
00:48:51,929 --> 00:48:54,097
You hear "lives,"
and you think human lives.

706
00:48:54,181 --> 00:48:56,558
Of course,
we always think of ourselves first.

707
00:49:00,270 --> 00:49:05,233
I'm trying to save a bird, a subspecies
of the northwestern brown swallow.

708
00:49:05,317 --> 00:49:08,904
I doubt I'll succeed. The loggers,
they work faster than one person can.

709
00:49:08,987 --> 00:49:11,323
You planted all those trees yourself?

710
00:49:11,406 --> 00:49:12,824
Mm-hmm.

711
00:49:15,661 --> 00:49:17,204
How long will you stay here?

712
00:49:18,080 --> 00:49:19,748
My whole life if I have to.

713
00:49:22,501 --> 00:49:25,170
How many people
get the chance to save a species?

714
00:49:25,837 --> 00:49:30,509
Ten thousand species go extinct
every year because of the greed of one.

715
00:49:33,387 --> 00:49:35,472
May I ask why <i>you</i> are here?

716
00:49:37,182 --> 00:49:41,395
We are looking for a site
to build a radio astronomy laboratory.

717
00:49:41,478 --> 00:49:42,478
Here?

718
00:49:43,188 --> 00:49:45,941
- This land isn't yours.
- It shouldn't belong to anyone.

719
00:49:46,024 --> 00:49:47,442
It belongs to the People.

720
00:49:47,526 --> 00:49:49,319
And the People will destroy it.

721
00:49:49,403 --> 00:49:52,489
Ruin an entire ecosystem for a radio lab.

722
00:49:53,031 --> 00:49:54,408
It doesn't trouble you?

723
00:49:56,451 --> 00:49:58,203
The stupidity of the People?

724
00:50:01,957 --> 00:50:03,208
It isn't up to me.

725
00:50:10,841 --> 00:50:12,134
I have work to do.

726
00:50:13,010 --> 00:50:14,678
[in Mandarin] What did he say?

727
00:50:14,761 --> 00:50:16,304
He understands.

728
00:50:16,388 --> 00:50:18,557
[in English] Yes, I understand. Please go.

729
00:50:32,529 --> 00:50:34,531
[tense music playing]

730
00:50:36,908 --> 00:50:40,412
[in English] "In nature,
nothing exists alone."

731
00:50:56,428 --> 00:50:57,679
What's your name?

732
00:50:57,763 --> 00:50:58,764
Ye Wenjie.

733
00:51:00,474 --> 00:51:01,475
Mike Evans.

734
00:51:05,937 --> 00:51:08,106
- I will try to stop them.
- [Evans sighs]

735
00:51:16,281 --> 00:51:18,575
[in Mandarin] Ye Wenjie,
we have discussed it,

736
00:51:18,658 --> 00:51:19,659
Commissar Lei and I...

737
00:51:19,743 --> 00:51:22,329
Site 1 fits all the parameters.

738
00:51:22,412 --> 00:51:23,514
Minimal electromagnetic interference,

739
00:51:23,538 --> 00:51:24,557
access to good roads for construction...

740
00:51:24,581 --> 00:51:26,166
That's true of Site 2 as well.

741
00:51:26,333 --> 00:51:28,043
The villagers at Site 2...

742
00:51:28,126 --> 00:51:29,878
Are desperate for work.

743
00:51:29,961 --> 00:51:31,505
Too desperate.

744
00:51:31,588 --> 00:51:34,800
They'll see the lab
as a piece of meat to take bites from.

745
00:51:35,675 --> 00:51:39,012
Commissar Lei and I have decided,
together, that Site 2 is better.

746
00:51:39,513 --> 00:51:40,597
[Ye Wenjie sighs]

747
00:51:40,680 --> 00:51:43,100
I know you're disappointed.

748
00:51:44,476 --> 00:51:48,855
You're sure it's not because
you're trying to help the American?

749
00:51:48,939 --> 00:51:53,860
You've been doing good work
for eight years. Don't throw it away.

750
00:51:57,322 --> 00:51:59,157
There is something I can do for you.

751
00:52:00,283 --> 00:52:03,120
The Commissar gave me
the names and records

752
00:52:03,203 --> 00:52:05,413
of the new arrivals
at the work camp in Qiqihar.

753
00:52:05,497 --> 00:52:07,916
In case there's anyone
who could be useful for us.

754
00:52:08,959 --> 00:52:13,130
No scientists, unfortunately.
But there's a woman called Tang Hongjing.

755
00:52:13,213 --> 00:52:15,632
She used to be a Red Guard.

756
00:52:15,715 --> 00:52:19,845
During a struggle session
at Tsinghua University in 1966,

757
00:52:19,928 --> 00:52:22,848
she dealt a fatal blow to a professor

758
00:52:24,474 --> 00:52:26,309
called Ye Zhetai.

759
00:52:47,247 --> 00:52:49,499
[official speaking Mandarin]

760
00:53:16,401 --> 00:53:20,405
This is a new era. The past is finished.

761
00:53:20,488 --> 00:53:23,200
The past is not finished.

762
00:53:23,283 --> 00:53:25,911
You want me to repent?

763
00:53:25,994 --> 00:53:27,996
You don't think you should?

764
00:53:28,079 --> 00:53:30,457
Then who will repent for me?

765
00:53:30,540 --> 00:53:33,501
Who will atone for what I have lost?

766
00:53:34,127 --> 00:53:38,298
The Party sent me to Shaanxi
to work the wheat fields.

767
00:53:38,381 --> 00:53:40,175
After a day's work,

768
00:53:40,258 --> 00:53:42,719
I didn't even have the energy
to wash my clothes.

769
00:53:42,802 --> 00:53:47,307
We slept on the ground at night.
Listening to the sound of wolves.

770
00:53:47,390 --> 00:53:52,437
My arm was infected with gangrene.

771
00:53:52,520 --> 00:53:55,273
The guards pinned me down...

772
00:53:57,442 --> 00:54:00,445
and cut it off me.

773
00:54:04,699 --> 00:54:05,825
[crying softly]

774
00:54:05,909 --> 00:54:08,703
I was just a kid.

775
00:54:09,454 --> 00:54:15,126
I was just a kid when I watched you

776
00:54:17,087 --> 00:54:21,967
break my father's skull with a belt.

777
00:54:23,885 --> 00:54:26,888
They told me you're clever.

778
00:54:27,180 --> 00:54:29,516
And you should be.

779
00:54:29,599 --> 00:54:32,602
Daughter of an academic.

780
00:54:32,811 --> 00:54:35,021
I was not clever.

781
00:54:35,480 --> 00:54:38,275
I had no utility.

782
00:54:38,358 --> 00:54:41,278
Your mind spared you.

783
00:54:41,361 --> 00:54:45,448
Otherwise you would have ended up
the same as me.

784
00:54:46,074 --> 00:54:51,246
My father's mind did not spare him.

785
00:54:51,329 --> 00:54:54,207
Even now

786
00:54:56,293 --> 00:55:00,463
I would scythe him like wheat.

787
00:55:04,050 --> 00:55:06,886
You will not repent?

788
00:55:11,599 --> 00:55:16,521
No one repents.

789
00:55:16,604 --> 00:55:18,606
[somber orchestral music playing]

790
00:55:22,068 --> 00:55:24,070
[static pulsating]

791
00:55:42,881 --> 00:55:44,883
[static warbling]

792
00:55:48,053 --> 00:55:50,930
[buzzing]

793
00:55:51,014 --> 00:55:52,682
[tense music playing]

794
00:56:11,368 --> 00:56:13,578
Signal coherence rating: AAAAA

795
00:56:55,537 --> 00:56:59,207
Do not answer. Do not answer.
Do not answer.

796
00:57:03,545 --> 00:57:07,924
I am a pacifist in this world.

797
00:57:08,007 --> 00:57:12,387
You are lucky that I am
the first to receive your message.

798
00:57:14,931 --> 00:57:18,101
I am warning you: do not answer.

799
00:57:18,184 --> 00:57:21,396
If you respond, we will come.

800
00:57:21,479 --> 00:57:25,525
Your world will be conquered.

801
00:57:25,608 --> 00:57:27,861
[Ye Wenjie breathing shakily]

802
00:57:29,612 --> 00:57:31,781
Do not answer.

803
00:57:46,880 --> 00:57:49,090
[tense music builds slowly]

804
00:57:53,928 --> 00:57:55,930
[wind gusting]

805
00:57:57,724 --> 00:58:00,768
[resolute string music playing]

806
00:58:00,852 --> 00:58:02,437
[Ye Wenjie exhales]

807
00:58:07,108 --> 00:58:08,985
[console whirring]

808
00:58:22,665 --> 00:58:24,667
[satellite dish groaning]

809
00:58:44,187 --> 00:58:46,189
[buttons clacking rapidly]

810
00:58:51,819 --> 00:58:53,321
[string music building]

811
00:59:02,789 --> 00:59:04,999
[music dies down]

812
00:59:05,500 --> 00:59:09,921
Come. We cannot save ourselves.

813
00:59:10,004 --> 00:59:15,009
I will help you conquer this world.

814
00:59:15,093 --> 00:59:17,095
[Ye Wenjie breathing shakily]

815
00:59:32,944 --> 00:59:34,946
[music fades out]

816
00:59:41,661 --> 00:59:43,580
[ominous closing theme playing]

817
01:01:39,779 --> 01:01:41,698
[closing theme fades]
