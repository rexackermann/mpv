1
00:00:12,679 --> 00:00:14,014
Why are there zombies here?

2
00:00:14,097 --> 00:00:15,098
I can't take this.

3
00:00:18,435 --> 00:00:20,687
Are you already...

4
00:00:21,521 --> 00:00:23,815
I'm still okay.

5
00:00:35,702 --> 00:00:37,620
Incoming!

6
00:00:39,330 --> 00:00:42,542
{\an8}<i>Wait for me, Mom and Dad!</i>

7
00:00:42,625 --> 00:00:44,085
{\an8}<i>I'll be there soon!</i>

8
00:01:56,282 --> 00:01:58,910
{\an8}ZOM 100: BUCKET LIST OF THE DEAD

9
00:01:58,993 --> 00:02:00,912
GOOD FORTUNE

10
00:02:00,995 --> 00:02:01,996
Charo!

11
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:04,415
Where are you, Charo?

12
00:02:04,499 --> 00:02:05,792
Charo.

13
00:02:07,293 --> 00:02:08,419
Charo!

14
00:02:08,503 --> 00:02:11,005
Now is not the time to be humping things!

15
00:02:11,506 --> 00:02:13,508
I was so worried about you!

16
00:02:25,728 --> 00:02:28,148
It's dangerous to run off on your own!

17
00:02:28,731 --> 00:02:30,775
But...

18
00:02:31,401 --> 00:02:34,612
Mommy and Daddy are already...

19
00:02:35,488 --> 00:02:38,241
Charo is all I have left!

20
00:02:47,584 --> 00:02:49,669
Anyway, it isn't safe here.

21
00:02:52,922 --> 00:02:54,090
All right!

22
00:02:54,674 --> 00:02:57,552
I doubt those zombies can climb ladders!

23
00:02:58,553 --> 00:03:01,264
Now we just wait
until the electric fence is deactivated.

24
00:03:01,347 --> 00:03:03,766
Mr. Kencho, over there.

25
00:03:11,149 --> 00:03:12,191
You're...

26
00:03:13,985 --> 00:03:15,069
You're going down.

27
00:03:17,155 --> 00:03:19,657
Each day, there was nothing for me.

28
00:03:20,199 --> 00:03:24,120
I fell farther and farther
until I reached the pit of misfortune.

29
00:03:24,203 --> 00:03:26,748
That's why you're
going to go down with me!

30
00:03:27,624 --> 00:03:29,000
Mr. Kencho!

31
00:03:31,377 --> 00:03:36,758
Just fall from here
and become zombie food!

32
00:03:39,594 --> 00:03:42,513
I need to do whatever it takes
to stop the water wheel!

33
00:03:43,598 --> 00:03:44,682
I see it!

34
00:04:11,292 --> 00:04:14,921
Curios from the Warring States Period
are nothing more than junk,

35
00:04:15,004 --> 00:04:16,673
especially against me.

36
00:04:18,758 --> 00:04:23,930
I was in the top four in the high school
Kendo Nationals two years in a row.

37
00:04:24,013 --> 00:04:28,268
Your samurai fangirling
is no match against me.

38
00:04:32,397 --> 00:04:34,065
Mrs. Tome! Old Man Hiko!

39
00:04:34,607 --> 00:04:36,442
We have to hurry and evacuate the village!

40
00:04:37,026 --> 00:04:38,069
Shizuka!

41
00:04:38,152 --> 00:04:41,572
If a horde of zombies come, they'll
break through this thin wooden door!

42
00:04:42,865 --> 00:04:46,202
Shizuka, calm down and listen.

43
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:51,082
We're all old
and we have difficulty moving around.

44
00:04:52,333 --> 00:04:56,296
Old Man Hiko
is mostly bedridden so we can't carry him.

45
00:04:57,171 --> 00:04:58,923
Listen, Shizuka.

46
00:04:59,007 --> 00:05:02,343
Don't worry about us
old-timers who don't have much time left.

47
00:05:02,427 --> 00:05:05,179
Please. You must try to survive.

48
00:05:05,847 --> 00:05:07,098
No way.

49
00:05:10,935 --> 00:05:13,521
At this rate,
Mrs. Tome and the others will be...

50
00:05:16,816 --> 00:05:17,984
Geez!

51
00:05:18,067 --> 00:05:19,861
Over here, you dumb zombies!

52
00:05:21,404 --> 00:05:24,240
- Shizuka?
- I'll get you out of there.

53
00:05:24,699 --> 00:05:27,702
So don't give up!

54
00:05:31,706 --> 00:05:33,875
I didn't analyze the risks at all!

55
00:05:33,958 --> 00:05:37,795
It's definitely
because of those happy-go-lucky dorks!

56
00:05:41,716 --> 00:05:45,470
The door won't hold for much longer!

57
00:05:49,724 --> 00:05:51,642
Incoming!

58
00:05:55,646 --> 00:05:56,856
Akira!

59
00:05:58,191 --> 00:06:01,569
I haven't done enough yet!

60
00:06:04,822 --> 00:06:07,617
I didn't make enough
to send you much money.

61
00:06:08,326 --> 00:06:10,578
I never took you on any trips overseas.

62
00:06:12,622 --> 00:06:15,124
I haven't found anyone to marry yet.

63
00:06:15,708 --> 00:06:18,586
So giving you grandkids is a long way off.

64
00:06:20,171 --> 00:06:23,341
I haven't done enough for you yet!

65
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:26,511
I'm not going to apologize
in front of your graves.

66
00:06:26,594 --> 00:06:29,847
There are so many things

67
00:06:30,389 --> 00:06:34,936
I want to do while you're still alive!

68
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:39,524
You greenhorn.

69
00:06:43,736 --> 00:06:44,779
Dad?

70
00:06:45,404 --> 00:06:47,990
You want to repay us that badly?

71
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:52,495
Then don't die before your parents.

72
00:06:53,412 --> 00:06:55,998
Take care of your mom.

73
00:06:56,624 --> 00:06:57,500
Da...

74
00:06:58,084 --> 00:07:00,545
Dad!

75
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:06,092
Hey, come on, it's okay.

76
00:07:06,968 --> 00:07:10,680
I don't want to go home yet.

77
00:07:11,347 --> 00:07:13,766
- I guess I have no choice.
<i>- Not wanting to go home...</i>

78
00:07:15,393 --> 00:07:16,811
<i>I feel the same way.</i>

79
00:07:17,603 --> 00:07:18,604
{\an8}WEDDING PHOTOS

80
00:07:18,688 --> 00:07:24,026
{\an8}<i>Like anybody, when I first got married,
I wanted a happy home.</i>

81
00:07:24,819 --> 00:07:27,780
<i>But before I realized it,
that place stopped being my home.</i>

82
00:07:28,406 --> 00:07:32,285
<i>So, everyday I killed some time at bars
and internet caf√©s before going home.</i>

83
00:07:33,202 --> 00:07:36,038
<i>My car was the only place
where I could relax.</i>

84
00:07:38,416 --> 00:07:42,336
I heard that Mrs. Yoneda's husband
was promoted to section chief.

85
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:46,048
Her whole family is going to Singapore
over the long weekend. Isn't that nice?

86
00:07:46,132 --> 00:07:50,219
Anyway, we're going out
to eat as a family.

87
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:54,307
<i>My relationship with my wife
had already gone cold.</i>

88
00:07:54,390 --> 00:07:58,311
<i>We would talk about once a week, but it'd
only be snide remarks or name-calling.</i>

89
00:07:58,394 --> 00:08:02,064
<i>I no longer had the energy
to repair my relationships.</i>

90
00:08:02,523 --> 00:08:05,693
<i>I wondered why
I was working myself to the bone</i>

91
00:08:05,776 --> 00:08:09,739
<i>for a family
I had lost all love and affection for?</i>

92
00:08:11,991 --> 00:08:13,409
My wife is such a bitch!

93
00:08:14,035 --> 00:08:14,911
Whenever she talks,

94
00:08:14,994 --> 00:08:18,498
it's to nag me to keep the bathroom clean
or to hurry to get a promotion.

95
00:08:18,581 --> 00:08:21,834
Shut up already!

96
00:08:29,967 --> 00:08:31,719
I found you!

97
00:08:37,141 --> 00:08:40,728
A girl and I alone in a place like this.

98
00:08:40,811 --> 00:08:43,356
I'm so lucky.

99
00:08:45,024 --> 00:08:47,985
Lucky? What do you mean by that?

100
00:08:48,945 --> 00:08:54,200
The thing I want to do most is
to "force my tongue down a girl's throat."

101
00:08:54,283 --> 00:08:56,118
7. FORCE MY TONGUE DOWN A GIRL'S THROAT

102
00:08:56,202 --> 00:08:58,579
This is even worse than a zombie!

103
00:08:58,663 --> 00:09:00,331
You're not getting away!

104
00:09:00,414 --> 00:09:02,875
What's the problem?
It's just a French kiss!

105
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:04,877
It's no big deal!

106
00:09:05,461 --> 00:09:06,671
<i>No way! Absolutely not!</i>

107
00:09:06,754 --> 00:09:10,883
<i>I'd rather be eaten by zombies
than be French kissed by that guy!</i>

108
00:09:11,342 --> 00:09:14,095
<i>I've never had luck with women or money.</i>

109
00:09:14,178 --> 00:09:16,305
<i>I've had nothing but bad luck all my life.</i>

110
00:09:16,389 --> 00:09:20,476
<i>I'm saying goodbye to that unlucky life!</i>

111
00:09:21,477 --> 00:09:23,437
<i>- Five</i> covers!
- Is the pasta ready yet?

112
00:09:23,521 --> 00:09:26,399
- Carpaccio at table number seven.
- Come on! The orders are piling up!

113
00:09:26,482 --> 00:09:27,358
Excuse me.

114
00:09:28,568 --> 00:09:32,154
Was <i>"sette"</i> supposed to be six?

115
00:09:33,197 --> 00:09:36,826
{\an8}Listen, you haven't learned
a single number yet.

116
00:09:36,909 --> 00:09:39,078
How are you going to take orders?

117
00:09:39,662 --> 00:09:42,873
But no one taught me anything.

118
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:48,838
And besides they could just tell me
in Japanese, right?

119
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:51,841
- He's making excuses again.
- He's always doing this.

120
00:09:52,883 --> 00:09:56,679
Why are the senior workers and the owner
so mean to me?

121
00:09:59,932 --> 00:10:01,934
I've got the worst luck.

122
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:04,186
Oops.

123
00:10:05,021 --> 00:10:09,692
They're going to bitch about
how that's not the way good chefs behave.

124
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:21,829
<i>This is why I told them
we should put ashtrays in the kitchen.</i>

125
00:10:22,538 --> 00:10:24,290
<i>Looks like I'm getting fired again.</i>

126
00:10:24,373 --> 00:10:26,709
<i>I've really got the worst luck.</i>

127
00:10:28,544 --> 00:10:32,590
So what if the restaurant burned down
because I forgot to put out my cigarette?

128
00:10:33,716 --> 00:10:36,719
I lost my job just like everyone else!

129
00:10:36,802 --> 00:10:40,723
I don't see why they had
to get so mad at me!

130
00:10:40,806 --> 00:10:46,937
No matter how you think about it,
I'm the unlucky one!

131
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:52,610
Old Man Hiko?

132
00:10:55,196 --> 00:10:56,364
Akemi?

133
00:11:06,374 --> 00:11:07,583
Not bad.

134
00:11:08,751 --> 00:11:10,711
<i>I can barely parry.</i>

135
00:11:12,797 --> 00:11:17,468
The problem with this baby is that it
attracts zombies with the noise it makes.

136
00:11:17,968 --> 00:11:20,429
So let's make this quick.

137
00:11:20,554 --> 00:11:23,891
Why would you do something so evil?

138
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:25,476
Evil?

139
00:11:26,811 --> 00:11:30,981
I'm only doing what's right!

140
00:11:32,274 --> 00:11:36,320
But everyone just complains about me!

141
00:11:37,321 --> 00:11:41,784
Mr. Takaoka,
the glue stick goes next to the stapler.

142
00:11:42,284 --> 00:11:44,370
I've warned you countless times,
haven't I?

143
00:11:44,453 --> 00:11:47,623
Section chief, I can't believe
you're rejecting my plan.

144
00:11:47,706 --> 00:11:49,750
This workplace is barely functioning!

145
00:11:49,834 --> 00:11:50,960
Department chief,

146
00:11:51,043 --> 00:11:54,130
should you be letting people
who make such mistakes slide?

147
00:11:54,213 --> 00:11:55,673
Was it the usual?

148
00:11:55,756 --> 00:11:58,259
She did it again. Wow.

149
00:11:58,342 --> 00:12:02,221
It's really exhausting
working with her, isn't it?

150
00:12:02,304 --> 00:12:05,433
She's so self-righteous
and pushy about it!

151
00:12:06,475 --> 00:12:07,518
Shut up.

152
00:12:08,310 --> 00:12:15,276
You coddled snowflakes
are the ones at fault!

153
00:12:18,863 --> 00:12:21,157
What have we ever done to you?

154
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:26,162
- Quit blaming others for your problems...
- I'm the victim here!

155
00:12:27,246 --> 00:12:30,791
"I am the victim in the marriage"?
Don't make me laugh!

156
00:12:30,875 --> 00:12:34,545
Just because she couldn't reach me
when she gave birth?

157
00:12:34,628 --> 00:12:37,923
I was entertaining clients
when I didn't want to!

158
00:12:38,007 --> 00:12:42,428
She continued to hold a grudge
about how scared she was being by herself!

159
00:12:42,511 --> 00:12:45,431
No matter how you think about it,
I'm the victim!

160
00:12:45,514 --> 00:12:48,184
I thought that was the case!

161
00:12:49,185 --> 00:12:52,563
You can badmouth your woman
however you like,

162
00:12:52,646 --> 00:12:58,319
but have you given her even a single
flower for a wedding anniversary?

163
00:12:59,904 --> 00:13:03,574
Have you thanked her for taking care
of the house every day

164
00:13:03,657 --> 00:13:06,827
or listened to her complaints
or true feelings?

165
00:13:08,412 --> 00:13:14,084
Did you ever treat her
like she was the queen of your universe?

166
00:13:16,670 --> 00:13:22,092
The reason she lost interest in you
is because you let her down!

167
00:13:22,593 --> 00:13:24,637
You never made an effort to love her.

168
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:29,892
You never gave her anything,
and you expected her to take care of you?

169
00:13:30,518 --> 00:13:33,604
She's not your mother!

170
00:13:34,813 --> 00:13:37,107
Shut up!

171
00:13:37,983 --> 00:13:39,485
Enough of that!

172
00:13:39,568 --> 00:13:44,365
You two are going down with me!

173
00:13:45,032 --> 00:13:46,033
Fine.

174
00:13:46,534 --> 00:13:51,622
If you want to go down,
I'll go down with you as you wish!

175
00:13:51,705 --> 00:13:53,499
Mr. Kencho!

176
00:13:55,084 --> 00:13:57,878
What the hell are you thinking?

177
00:13:58,420 --> 00:14:01,632
<i>What's triggering
the zombies to attack us?</i>

178
00:14:01,715 --> 00:14:05,261
<i>Our movements? Our smell?
Or is it our body heat?</i>

179
00:14:05,344 --> 00:14:07,012
<i>It doesn't matter what it is.</i>

180
00:14:07,096 --> 00:14:12,810
<i>If I want to mask all of that,
this is my only option!</i>

181
00:14:18,482 --> 00:14:20,651
Wha...

182
00:14:21,527 --> 00:14:24,238
You're joking, right? Head first?

183
00:14:27,491 --> 00:14:30,077
No. Stop!

184
00:14:30,744 --> 00:14:33,414
Stay away!

185
00:14:47,887 --> 00:14:52,182
If you're going to go down,
don't choose a pit of despair.

186
00:14:52,266 --> 00:14:56,395
If you had chosen the cesspit,
you could've avoided becoming a zombie.

187
00:14:59,398 --> 00:15:03,193
Don't come near me
until you've taken a bath.

188
00:15:04,862 --> 00:15:06,280
<i>Akemi?</i>

189
00:15:07,114 --> 00:15:10,409
Where did Akemi go?

190
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:12,620
Old Man Hiko,

191
00:15:12,703 --> 00:15:17,333
Shizuka is using herself
as bait to protect us from the zombies.

192
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:22,838
And? What are you all still doing here?

193
00:15:22,922 --> 00:15:24,048
What are we doing?

194
00:15:24,131 --> 00:15:27,468
We're old.
We can't move as well as we'd like to.

195
00:15:27,551 --> 00:15:29,053
Even if we went to save her...

196
00:15:29,136 --> 00:15:33,307
Has anything ever gone the way
we wanted it to?

197
00:15:34,683 --> 00:15:38,687
Large-scale projects declined
following the post-war land reform,

198
00:15:38,771 --> 00:15:40,689
and the TPP was looming.

199
00:15:40,773 --> 00:15:43,192
We were unsure
of who our successors would be.

200
00:15:43,275 --> 00:15:48,781
Even so, we desperately clung
to our hoes and managed, didn't we?

201
00:15:50,699 --> 00:15:52,826
Typhoons, sweltering heat, freezing cold...

202
00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:57,122
No matter how many times
nature ferociously tried to beat us down,

203
00:15:57,206 --> 00:15:59,875
we'd grit our teeth and say,
"This is the year!"

204
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:02,878
We've survived this long, haven't we?

205
00:16:03,545 --> 00:16:07,383
Who cares about some zombies?

206
00:16:08,717 --> 00:16:12,262
Hey, are you aware of
the recognitive hyper-focalization theory?

207
00:16:12,346 --> 00:16:13,931
Recogni... What?

208
00:16:14,473 --> 00:16:17,810
It's a theory that attempts
to scientifically define luck.

209
00:16:18,477 --> 00:16:20,521
{\an8}Do you only care about yourself?

210
00:16:20,604 --> 00:16:26,777
{\an8}Does your concern extend to family,
lovers, friends or complete strangers?

211
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:29,780
{\an8}All that matters is today?
Or Tomorrow too?

212
00:16:29,863 --> 00:16:33,659
{\an8}Are you considering the next generation
or society as a whole?

213
00:16:33,742 --> 00:16:38,622
When you face a challenge,
who else do you consider?

214
00:16:38,706 --> 00:16:43,585
The larger the scope of your
consideration, the more luck you have.

215
00:16:43,669 --> 00:16:46,296
Showing off how smart you are
even at a time like this?

216
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:48,298
Who cares about any of that?

217
00:16:48,382 --> 00:16:52,136
At this very moment, I'm the lucky one!

218
00:16:52,219 --> 00:16:55,055
You're the one with bad luck!

219
00:16:55,139 --> 00:16:56,807
CAUTION FIRE DANGER

220
00:17:08,318 --> 00:17:09,570
Old Man Hiko!

221
00:17:12,364 --> 00:17:15,200
You really are the finest hunter
in the village!

222
00:17:16,744 --> 00:17:19,705
That was just a lucky shot!
What's one old man going to do?

223
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:24,585
Who the hell are you guys?

224
00:17:26,670 --> 00:17:29,840
Anyone who gets rough with our Shizuka...

225
00:17:29,923 --> 00:17:32,051
...gets no mercy, no matter who they are!

226
00:17:32,134 --> 00:17:34,470
Whippersnapper!

227
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:44,938
I was so close.

228
00:17:45,022 --> 00:17:49,485
Why do I have such bad luck?

229
00:17:49,568 --> 00:17:53,363
You only think about yourself
and the immediate present.

230
00:17:54,198 --> 00:17:59,495
Someone so self-absorbed
will never be blessed with good luck.

231
00:17:59,578 --> 00:18:01,121
Shizuka!

232
00:18:01,205 --> 00:18:02,498
Are you all right?

233
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:04,249
Thank you!

234
00:18:04,333 --> 00:18:05,959
I'm really lucky...

235
00:18:08,212 --> 00:18:09,713
you all showed up!

236
00:18:13,675 --> 00:18:18,847
Wrong-minded people who get in my way
should all become zombies!

237
00:18:18,931 --> 00:18:21,391
I'm the one who is right!

238
00:18:24,728 --> 00:18:26,522
In my country,

239
00:18:26,605 --> 00:18:29,817
it's normal to toss your cigarette butts
on the ground as you walk.

240
00:18:31,610 --> 00:18:35,280
Supermarket cashiers
chew gum as they serve customers,

241
00:18:35,364 --> 00:18:40,369
and vacuuming on Sunday, a day of rest,
is rude because everyone wants to relax.

242
00:18:41,036 --> 00:18:44,706
On your birthdays, you organize
your own party and treat others to food.

243
00:18:45,582 --> 00:18:48,794
I'm sure that this all sounds
absurd to you.

244
00:18:48,877 --> 00:18:53,298
But that was normal life for me.

245
00:18:53,382 --> 00:18:57,553
Are you trying to say I'm wrong too?

246
00:18:57,636 --> 00:19:02,349
I don't give a damn about your culture!

247
00:19:02,432 --> 00:19:08,063
All wrong-minded people should
just shut up and become zombies!

248
00:19:16,446 --> 00:19:17,614
No way!

249
00:19:18,448 --> 00:19:20,784
You took advantage of the zombies
gathering here...

250
00:19:25,372 --> 00:19:29,126
to destroy the water wheel
and cut the power?

251
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:32,045
That's just crazy.

252
00:19:32,754 --> 00:19:36,258
This is absolutely
the wrong way of doing it.

253
00:19:37,509 --> 00:19:41,305
There is no perfectly right way
of doing things.

254
00:19:42,264 --> 00:19:47,227
There are all sorts of people
and they make the world a colorful place.

255
00:19:47,853 --> 00:19:51,273
Perhaps instead of forcing
what you thought was right on others,

256
00:19:51,356 --> 00:19:58,363
you should have stopped and questioned
whether you might have been wrong?

257
00:20:22,930 --> 00:20:24,348
This certainly is a problem.

258
00:20:26,099 --> 00:20:28,018
I can't get down from here.

259
00:20:36,485 --> 00:20:37,444
Dad!

260
00:20:37,527 --> 00:20:39,196
Don't open it!

261
00:20:39,947 --> 00:20:41,615
Absolutely do not open it, Akira!

262
00:20:42,407 --> 00:20:45,535
If you do, you'll be putting your mom
and the others in danger!

263
00:20:57,881 --> 00:20:58,840
Dad.

264
00:21:02,761 --> 00:21:05,305
Just a few more.

265
00:21:08,725 --> 00:21:10,352
<i>This is terrible.</i>

266
00:21:10,435 --> 00:21:12,104
<i>At a time like this?</i>

267
00:21:15,857 --> 00:21:19,611
<i>Looks like my time has come at last.</i>

268
00:21:20,195 --> 00:21:22,197
<i>How pathetic.</i>

269
00:21:22,823 --> 00:21:25,200
Dad!

270
00:21:29,204 --> 00:21:30,747
Higurashi?

271
00:21:30,831 --> 00:21:33,208
Why are you saving my dad?

272
00:21:35,419 --> 00:21:37,462
So, I was thinking.

273
00:21:37,963 --> 00:21:40,465
You're pretty tough, right?

274
00:21:41,133 --> 00:21:45,887
So, how can I make sure
you become a zombie?

275
00:21:45,971 --> 00:21:47,639
That's when I got it.

276
00:21:47,723 --> 00:21:51,351
I found the perfect situation!

277
00:21:52,853 --> 00:21:54,146
Listen up.

278
00:21:54,229 --> 00:22:00,694
If you don't want me to kick your dad
down, open that door and get zombified.

279
00:22:00,777 --> 00:22:03,405
You want to repay your parents, right?

280
00:22:03,488 --> 00:22:09,244
Then show your dad
just how good a son your are!

281
00:22:11,997 --> 00:22:12,914
<i>What?</i>

282
00:23:47,175 --> 00:23:50,137
<i>Next Time: Hometown of the Dead III.</i>
