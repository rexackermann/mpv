the master ofJordan College

405

00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:48,680
The trouble is, I believe
the only reason he gave it to you

409
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:52,350
was because he wanted it to fall
into Lord Asriel's hands.

And if there's one thing
that man doesn't need,

it's more toys to do damage with.

not to tell me about it.

I need to free him.

531
00:42:47,120 --> 00:42:48,520
Go well.

532
00:42:59,640 --> 00:43:02,872
- Is this the balloon driver?
- I'm an aeronaut, kid. Lee Scoresby.

533
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:08,591
- And this is...?
- This is Iorek.

534
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:11,519
- This is Iorek?
- Hmm. Yeah.

535
00:43:11,640 --> 00:43:13,950
He just doesn't look like
how I imagined him.

536
00:43:14,080 --> 00:43:16,436
You were hoping for better-looking?
Weren't we all?

537
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:18,438
We need to take to the skies.

538
00:43:20,040 --> 00:43:21,872
You all right with heights, Roger?

539
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,515
- Not really.
- You'll learn to be.

540
00:43:24,640 --> 00:43:26,120
Balloon driver!

541
00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:27,640
Let's go!

542
00:44:30,200 --> 00:44:31,714
I thought you might need a tow.

543
00:44:31,840 --> 00:44:33,957
Well, thank you, Miss Pekkala.

544
00:44:34,080 --> 00:44:37,391
Always good to see you in the skies,
Mr Scoresby.

545
00:44:37,520 --> 00:44:39,716
Your daemon is examining me.

546
00:44:39,840 --> 00:44:42,753
Well, it's been a while
since we've seen you.

547
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:44,496
LEE: That was quite a performance earlier.

548
00:44:44,520 --> 00:44:45,840
Thank you.

549
00:44:45,960 --> 00:44:49,715
Question - what can
we expect going forward

550
00:44:49,840 --> 00:44:52,674
in the sense of mayhem and chaos?

551
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:55,110
There may be fighting,
but you've fought before.

552
00:44:55,240 --> 00:44:56,799
And gladly.

553
00:44:56,920 --> 00:44:59,071
But as the situation
grows more complicated,

554
00:44:59,200 --> 00:45:03,274
so <i>my</i> situation grows
more... complicated.

555
00:45:03,400 --> 00:45:06,154
The child is destined
to be important -

556
00:45:06,280 --> 00:45:09,079
to create and resolve conflict.

557
00:45:09,200 --> 00:45:11,556
So this is about her.

558
00:45:11,680 --> 00:45:13,831
She matters more than
she can ever know.

559
00:45:13,960 --> 00:45:17,715
The fate of more than this world
depends on her.

560
00:45:19,120 --> 00:45:21,112
Well, I had a contract
with the Gyptians

561
00:45:21,240 --> 00:45:23,596
over what was accomplished
in Bolvangar.

562
00:45:23,720 --> 00:45:27,191
This... This seems like
a whole new thing,

563
00:45:27,320 --> 00:45:30,074
which requires, if I'm honest,
new contracts and new payments...

564
00:45:30,200 --> 00:45:31,919
She will need you, Lee.

565
00:45:32,040 --> 00:45:35,954
You know, a man should have a choice
whether to take up arms or not.

566
00:45:36,080 --> 00:45:37,958
And you need her.

567
00:45:39,200 --> 00:45:41,160
That's not how I expected
this conversation to go.

568
00:45:41,240 --> 00:45:42,390
Is it not?

569
00:45:42,520 --> 00:45:45,216
No, I was hoping you would find a way of
chucking me some danger money.

570
00:45:45,240 --> 00:45:47,152
Instead, you blindsided me with...

571
00:45:48,240 --> 00:45:49,240
...love.

572
00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:53,996
Good.

573
00:45:55,880 --> 00:45:58,190
The polar star will guide you
to Asriel.

574
00:45:58,320 --> 00:46:00,915
The wind is strong.
You're a capable navigator.

575
00:46:01,040 --> 00:46:03,396
So it's me. She's responsible
for the fate of everything,

576
00:46:03,520 --> 00:46:04,795
and I'm responsible...

577
00:46:05,880 --> 00:46:07,075
...for her?

578
00:46:08,480 --> 00:46:10,790
The world is in your hands,
Mr Scoresby...

579
00:46:10,920 --> 00:46:13,833
...and I am delighted it is.

580
00:46:19,360 --> 00:46:21,636
- Impressive.
- Yep.

581
00:46:23,120 --> 00:46:25,396
And they want <i>you</i>
on their team?

582
00:46:25,520 --> 00:46:27,239
Shut up, Hester.

583
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:43,755
FARDER CORAM: Poor little things.
Can't even speak any more.

584
00:46:48,960 --> 00:46:50,599
TONY COSTA: That's it. This way.

585
00:46:58,960 --> 00:47:01,600
FARDER CORAM: Cages loaded. Ready to go.

586
00:47:13,240 --> 00:47:14,515
Move out.

587
00:47:20,440 --> 00:47:23,035
I can't help worrying about
what happens when we get them home.

588
00:47:23,160 --> 00:47:24,480
What do you mean?

589
00:47:24,600 --> 00:47:26,557
We'll return them to their parents.

590
00:47:26,680 --> 00:47:28,672
And if they don't take them?

591
00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:31,235
Even those that love them
may be frightened

592
00:47:31,360 --> 00:47:33,829
to see them so... different.

593
00:47:33,960 --> 00:47:37,590
Those that they don't take back
will come join us as Gyptians.

594
00:47:37,720 --> 00:47:39,154
You did well.

595
00:47:40,200 --> 00:47:41,714
Well?

596
00:47:41,840 --> 00:47:43,513
We all fought them, at least.

597
00:47:43,640 --> 00:47:46,155
We did better than fight them.
We defeated them.

598
00:47:47,680 --> 00:47:49,717
Billy won't be the last child they hurt,

599
00:47:49,840 --> 00:47:52,594
but we made it much harder for 'em.

600
00:47:53,720 --> 00:47:55,916
I thought we'd be bringing him home,
Maggie.

601
00:47:58,160 --> 00:48:00,072
He'd be so proud of us.

602
00:48:01,520 --> 00:48:03,512
The way we helped the other children.

603
00:48:03,640 --> 00:48:04,835
Helped Lyra.

604
00:48:08,840 --> 00:48:10,911
She's a fighter, that one.

605
00:48:11,040 --> 00:48:13,111
Reminds me of someone I know.
