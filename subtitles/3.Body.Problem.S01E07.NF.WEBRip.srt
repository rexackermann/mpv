1
00:00:06,006 --> 00:00:07,716
All right, you see the Big Dipper?

2
00:00:07,799 --> 00:00:10,301
Now, keep going up
to those two stars up there

3
00:00:10,385 --> 00:00:13,388
along that same line
that sort of form the handle of the pan.

4
00:00:13,471 --> 00:00:14,472
Uh-huh.

5
00:00:14,556 --> 00:00:16,725
Keep going up.
It's the first star that you see.

6
00:00:16,808 --> 00:00:18,560
- All right, got it.
- That's it.

7
00:00:18,643 --> 00:00:20,937
That's DX3906.

8
00:00:23,356 --> 00:00:25,150
That's not DX3906.

9
00:00:26,693 --> 00:00:30,822
Yeah, it is. The Stars Our Destination
people pointed it out in their telescope.

10
00:00:30,905 --> 00:00:32,991
No. No, that's... that's not it.

11
00:00:35,285 --> 00:00:37,078
It is. As soon as the paperwork came in,

12
00:00:37,162 --> 00:00:39,539
I checked its position
against the IAU designation.

13
00:00:39,622 --> 00:00:41,583
Fuck. Did I get the parallax wrong?

14
00:00:45,795 --> 00:00:48,631
Dude, how the fuck would I know
which one is DX3906?

15
00:00:48,715 --> 00:00:50,592
- You're an arsehole.
- No, no, no.

16
00:00:50,675 --> 00:00:52,719
That's DX3905.

17
00:00:52,802 --> 00:00:54,137
You're a fucking arsehole.

18
00:00:55,930 --> 00:00:57,515
Oh shit.

19
00:00:59,934 --> 00:01:00,935
How far away?

20
00:01:01,936 --> 00:01:04,689
Four hundred and 1.5 light-years.

21
00:01:06,816 --> 00:01:09,569
Think about the light
Jin's star is emitting right now.

22
00:01:09,652 --> 00:01:12,572
I mean, by the time it gets here,
the San-Ti will be here too.

23
00:01:12,655 --> 00:01:14,115
Don't ruin it.

24
00:01:16,451 --> 00:01:17,911
It's actually kinda red.

25
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:20,538
That's why I picked it.

26
00:01:21,081 --> 00:01:22,874
Visible to the naked eye.

27
00:01:23,458 --> 00:01:25,919
I wanted her to be able
to look into the night sky and say,

28
00:01:26,503 --> 00:01:27,921
"That one is mine."

29
00:01:28,421 --> 00:01:30,465
It feel good doin' something that crazy?

30
00:01:31,174 --> 00:01:32,509
Spending 19 million on...

31
00:01:32,592 --> 00:01:34,177
Nineteen point five.

32
00:01:34,969 --> 00:01:36,638
And yes, it did.

33
00:01:36,721 --> 00:01:38,848
Couldn't think of any better place
to put that money?

34
00:01:38,932 --> 00:01:39,933
Nope.

35
00:01:43,353 --> 00:01:45,396
You know,
you could just tell her it was you.

36
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:47,240
- I'm not telling her.
- If you did...

37
00:01:47,273 --> 00:01:49,251
- I'm not telling her.
- But you never know.

38
00:01:49,275 --> 00:01:51,069
You're not fuckin' telling her either.

39
00:01:51,152 --> 00:01:52,952
You have to swear someone
to secrecy before...

40
00:01:52,987 --> 00:01:57,909
Promise me you will never tell her.

41
00:02:03,289 --> 00:02:04,999
Whatever, dude.

42
00:02:12,549 --> 00:02:13,424
Will.

43
00:02:17,178 --> 00:02:20,098
Will? Hey. Wake up, bud. Come on. Wake up.

44
00:02:21,558 --> 00:02:23,643
Will? Will!

45
00:02:37,657 --> 00:02:39,457
You're there now, right?
How's he doing?

46
00:02:39,492 --> 00:02:40,785
<i>- He's good.</i>
- Yeah?

47
00:02:40,869 --> 00:02:42,704
<i>Yeah. In fact,
he's better than good.</i>

48
00:02:42,787 --> 00:02:43,913
<i>Hey, Will. Check this out.</i>

49
00:02:43,997 --> 00:02:46,708
<i>Look who it is.
He's as high as Willie Nelson right now.</i>

50
00:02:46,791 --> 00:02:49,752
You're <i>as high as Willie Nelson.</i>

51
00:02:49,836 --> 00:02:50,836
Hey.

52
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:51,963
<i>Hi, Jin.</i>

53
00:02:52,046 --> 00:02:53,673
Hi, Will.

54
00:02:53,756 --> 00:02:55,133
How you feeling?

55
00:02:55,216 --> 00:02:57,510
<i>"No immediate danger."</i>

56
00:02:57,594 --> 00:03:00,263
<i>That's what the doctor said.</i>

57
00:03:00,346 --> 00:03:01,973
<i>"No immediate danger."</i>

58
00:03:02,473 --> 00:03:04,475
<i>How many people can say that for sure?</i>

59
00:03:04,559 --> 00:03:06,019
- Hey, not me.
<i>- Oh!</i>

60
00:03:06,102 --> 00:03:08,479
<i>- This is a really good room.
- Yeah.</i>

61
00:03:08,563 --> 00:03:10,356
<i>Fuck.</i>

62
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:12,317
<i>- Look at this.
- No. Don't touch that.</i>

63
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,484
- Wow.
<i>- Look.</i>

64
00:03:13,568 --> 00:03:15,008
<i>- All for me.</i>
- You deserve it.

65
00:03:15,069 --> 00:03:17,280
- 'Kay. Get some rest, okay?
<i>- Yeah.</i>

66
00:03:19,282 --> 00:03:20,200
<i>You get some rest.</i>

67
00:03:20,283 --> 00:03:22,285
<i>All right, buddy.
She's gonna get some rest.</i>

68
00:03:22,368 --> 00:03:24,412
<i>Yeah. So we're gonna hang here
for a while.</i>

69
00:03:24,495 --> 00:03:26,414
<i>We'll probably watch</i> Rick and Morty <i>later.</i>

70
00:03:26,497 --> 00:03:28,291
- Cool.
<i>- So, um...</i>

71
00:03:31,169 --> 00:03:32,879
<i>Uh, come when... come when you can.</i>

72
00:03:36,382 --> 00:03:37,800
<i>- Uh...</i>
- Yeah, I will.

73
00:03:37,884 --> 00:03:38,885
Thanks, Saul.

74
00:03:39,719 --> 00:03:40,720
<i>See ya.</i>

75
00:03:46,142 --> 00:03:47,302
Something came for you.

76
00:03:53,066 --> 00:03:56,027
Fuck me.
Aren't those insanely expensive?

77
00:03:56,986 --> 00:03:58,321
No sign at all who it's from?

78
00:03:58,404 --> 00:03:59,906
- Nope.
- Uh...

79
00:04:01,115 --> 00:04:03,910
Well, you've had
lots of fancy suitors, I'd imagine.

80
00:04:03,993 --> 00:04:04,993
I have.

81
00:04:05,662 --> 00:04:07,580
But none with that kind of money.

82
00:04:07,664 --> 00:04:09,832
I haven't known anyone
like that since Jack.

83
00:04:10,416 --> 00:04:11,751
Maybe Wade gave it to you.

84
00:04:11,834 --> 00:04:14,128
And why would he do that?

85
00:04:14,212 --> 00:04:15,380
Because he fancies you.

86
00:04:16,756 --> 00:04:18,716
- Oh, come on.
- No, you come on.

87
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:22,512
Jin, you seem to be in denial
about how weird this is.

88
00:04:22,595 --> 00:04:23,596
<i>This</i> is weird?

89
00:04:24,347 --> 00:04:26,849
This is maybe the 28th weirdest thing
I've seen this month.

90
00:04:26,933 --> 00:04:28,810
Adjust your weirdness horizons.

91
00:04:30,144 --> 00:04:34,357
Some crazy-rich person bought me a star,
or someone's taking the piss.

92
00:04:35,566 --> 00:04:37,986
Almost certainly
someone's taking the piss.

93
00:04:38,069 --> 00:04:40,196
Either way,
I don't have time to worry about it.

94
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:42,782
This is stupid. No one owns a star.

95
00:04:43,408 --> 00:04:45,326
Well, according to these documents,

96
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:49,038
you are the legal owner
of star number DX3906.

97
00:04:51,708 --> 00:04:54,627
For many years now,
Dr. Demikhov has been doing good work

98
00:04:54,711 --> 00:04:57,463
keeping things alive
under extreme conditions.

99
00:05:07,473 --> 00:05:09,726
- Uh, Dr. Cheng?
- Mm?

100
00:05:10,476 --> 00:05:11,894
Something to say?

101
00:05:13,896 --> 00:05:14,897
Well...

102
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:18,359
We were just wondering
if we belong in this meeting.

103
00:05:19,193 --> 00:05:20,695
Traveling 1% of light speed,

104
00:05:20,778 --> 00:05:23,489
how long will it take the Staircase probe
to reach the San-Ti fleet?

105
00:05:23,573 --> 00:05:24,949
Two hundred years.

106
00:05:25,033 --> 00:05:27,910
And what will happen
to the probe's occupant during that time?

107
00:05:27,994 --> 00:05:29,620
- Death.
- See?

108
00:05:29,704 --> 00:05:31,331
You do belong in this meeting.

109
00:05:34,042 --> 00:05:38,171
It's been a long struggle
with many setbacks, but we've done it.

110
00:05:49,766 --> 00:05:50,683
Is it alive?

111
00:05:50,767 --> 00:05:53,019
He's not dead. He's not alive.

112
00:05:53,102 --> 00:05:55,355
He's... somewhere in between.

113
00:05:56,189 --> 00:05:57,482
For a month now.

114
00:06:00,234 --> 00:06:02,445
How long
can he stay that way?

115
00:06:02,528 --> 00:06:04,238
As long as we like.

116
00:06:11,245 --> 00:06:14,749
Kolya's cells have been flushed
with an antifreeze cryoprotectant

117
00:06:14,832 --> 00:06:18,044
and cooled to minus 150 degrees.

118
00:06:18,127 --> 00:06:21,923
Slowed down a thousandfold
but not stopped.

119
00:06:39,607 --> 00:06:43,528
If it works for Kolya,
it will work for a person.

120
00:06:48,825 --> 00:06:51,202
Hello, Kolya.

121
00:06:57,458 --> 00:06:58,626
Mm-hmm.

122
00:07:05,466 --> 00:07:06,717
Say hello, Kolya.

123
00:07:08,052 --> 00:07:09,095
Good boy.

124
00:07:21,816 --> 00:07:22,816
Kolya.

125
00:07:23,025 --> 00:07:25,319
Touch the orange square.

126
00:07:35,121 --> 00:07:36,956
Ah.

127
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:38,833
Not yet.

128
00:07:40,042 --> 00:07:44,672
Touch the circle
with four squares inside it.

129
00:07:51,762 --> 00:07:54,223
Good boy, Kolya.

130
00:08:17,079 --> 00:08:19,332
It's a typical side effect.

131
00:08:20,416 --> 00:08:21,459
There it is.

132
00:08:21,542 --> 00:08:23,753
Our ticket to the end of the world.

133
00:08:23,836 --> 00:08:27,048
The Doomsday Express
just pulled into the station.

134
00:08:28,424 --> 00:08:30,218
You can all queue up behind me.

135
00:08:34,222 --> 00:08:35,982
<i>I thought
this was about the passenger.</i>

136
00:08:36,933 --> 00:08:39,644
<i>- You're</i> going into hibernation?
- As soon as I can.

137
00:08:39,727 --> 00:08:41,395
- Who's gonna run things here?
- I am.

138
00:08:41,479 --> 00:08:44,690
I'm gonna wake up for a week every year,
fix the fuckups, visit Mum,

139
00:08:44,774 --> 00:08:48,194
hire people, fire people, go to Wimbledon,
and then go back under.

140
00:08:48,277 --> 00:08:49,277
For 400 years?

141
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:51,360
Someone has to welcome them
when they arrive.

142
00:08:51,405 --> 00:08:52,949
Someone has to keep the plan on track.

143
00:08:53,032 --> 00:08:55,409
You could just train someone
to run Staircase.

144
00:08:55,493 --> 00:08:57,787
Staircase is a project, not a plan.

145
00:08:57,870 --> 00:08:59,205
Even you could run that.

146
00:08:59,288 --> 00:09:01,874
There are dozens of people
who could oversee the project.

147
00:09:01,958 --> 00:09:04,126
There's only one person on Earth
can oversee the plan.

148
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:05,461
On Earth? That's a bit much.

149
00:09:05,545 --> 00:09:08,631
Aristotle thought false humility
was just as bad as arrogance.

150
00:09:08,714 --> 00:09:12,218
Aristotle thought rocks fell down instead
of up because they loved the ground.

151
00:09:12,885 --> 00:09:14,512
Why only you? Why not someone else?

152
00:09:14,595 --> 00:09:15,888
No one else can handle it.

153
00:09:15,972 --> 00:09:19,392
What is this plan, this amazing plan,
that no one else but you can handle?

154
00:09:20,226 --> 00:09:21,894
Only advance.

155
00:09:24,146 --> 00:09:26,607
- I don't know what that means.
- You will when you get there.

156
00:09:27,650 --> 00:09:29,819
The future's not as far as it used to be.

157
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:32,154
Not for us.

158
00:09:38,244 --> 00:09:40,246
The Staircase probe needs a sail.

159
00:09:40,997 --> 00:09:45,042
It's a nanofiber weave,
not the single strand we've made so far.

160
00:09:45,126 --> 00:09:46,669
It's a lot more complicated.

161
00:09:46,752 --> 00:09:49,255
There's also heat
and stress tolerance to be considered,

162
00:09:49,338 --> 00:09:51,966
and the fibers need to connect
the probe to the sail and...

163
00:09:52,049 --> 00:09:53,718
And you can make it work?

164
00:09:57,179 --> 00:09:59,849
I can make it work, yes.

165
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:02,101
I'm glad you're here.

166
00:10:04,186 --> 00:10:06,272
You know why I started doing this work?

167
00:10:09,233 --> 00:10:13,112
The people I saw around me,
my mother's family...

168
00:10:15,865 --> 00:10:17,950
I saw what the world did to them.

169
00:10:18,868 --> 00:10:20,911
I wanted to build something for them.

170
00:10:24,123 --> 00:10:26,208
I ended up on the wrong side.

171
00:10:29,378 --> 00:10:31,380
You're not on the wrong side.

172
00:10:31,464 --> 00:10:33,507
Soon, we may be faced with a choice.

173
00:10:33,591 --> 00:10:35,259
Leave or die.

174
00:10:35,343 --> 00:10:37,136
Four hundred years is soon?

175
00:10:37,219 --> 00:10:38,459
It's the blink of an eye.

176
00:10:38,512 --> 00:10:41,766
And without the work we're doing,
there won't be a choice at all.

177
00:10:42,308 --> 00:10:45,019
We're building something for everyone.
We're building them a future.

178
00:10:45,936 --> 00:10:47,104
You believe that?

179
00:10:47,772 --> 00:10:49,023
Don't you?

180
00:10:49,106 --> 00:10:52,443
I want to. And some days,
I think it's possible.

181
00:10:54,487 --> 00:10:58,783
And some days, I think the people getting
fucked over will always get fucked over.

182
00:11:00,701 --> 00:11:03,245
They will always be the last in line.

183
00:11:04,163 --> 00:11:06,332
And none of them will get to sail away.

184
00:11:15,257 --> 00:11:16,257
<i>Will?</i>

185
00:11:18,094 --> 00:11:19,220
<i>Will?</i>

186
00:11:20,304 --> 00:11:21,764
<i>Wilbur?</i>

187
00:11:22,723 --> 00:11:25,267
Will, can you hear me?

188
00:11:27,812 --> 00:11:28,812
Will?

189
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:38,906
You all right, love?

190
00:11:38,989 --> 00:11:40,616
How'd you know I was here?

191
00:11:41,409 --> 00:11:43,452
The hospital contacted us.

192
00:11:44,245 --> 00:11:46,330
Roxanne is down as your next of kin.

193
00:11:47,206 --> 00:11:48,290
How you feeling?

194
00:11:50,292 --> 00:11:53,129
Well, I'm dying. So, there's that.

195
00:11:57,842 --> 00:11:58,926
It's been a while.

196
00:11:59,552 --> 00:12:02,430
It has. I know.
Um, we feel bad about that.

197
00:12:02,513 --> 00:12:03,431
We do.

198
00:12:03,514 --> 00:12:09,061
You know, Will, my job took us
to Spain and then Dubai.

199
00:12:09,145 --> 00:12:10,980
You didn't much like it abroad?

200
00:12:11,981 --> 00:12:16,569
Well, in the world of digital marketing,
it can get very political very fast.

201
00:12:16,652 --> 00:12:21,073
I mean, it's not about your skills.
It's all about playing the game.

202
00:12:21,157 --> 00:12:23,409
Yeah, it's probably the same
in what you do, Will.

203
00:12:23,492 --> 00:12:24,910
Physics and that.

204
00:12:25,453 --> 00:12:27,455
You were always the smartest one.

205
00:12:28,247 --> 00:12:33,335
That's why Mum and Dad sent you
to public school and uni and more uni.

206
00:12:35,254 --> 00:12:38,966
But you never got where you belonged
because you're not a game player.

207
00:12:40,634 --> 00:12:42,678
I got exactly where I belonged.

208
00:12:43,554 --> 00:12:45,890
I didn't get any further
because I wasn't smart enough.

209
00:12:45,973 --> 00:12:48,851
Well, you were smart enough
to do almost anything.

210
00:12:48,934 --> 00:12:50,644
You could've gone to work in the city.

211
00:12:50,728 --> 00:12:53,773
You could've started your own business.
You were the smartest person we knew.

212
00:12:55,816 --> 00:12:57,526
I didn't get to do physics.

213
00:12:58,652 --> 00:13:03,115
I had to go off
and do waitressing and filing and...

214
00:13:03,199 --> 00:13:05,201
Well...

215
00:13:06,535 --> 00:13:08,370
We want to start a family, Will.

216
00:13:09,121 --> 00:13:10,956
We want to be able to buy a home.

217
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:13,834
Look, we haven't been
what we should have been to each other.

218
00:13:13,918 --> 00:13:17,254
I know that,
and I take my portion of the blame for it.

219
00:13:18,214 --> 00:13:20,591
What's happened to you is fucking unfair.

220
00:13:22,218 --> 00:13:24,011
And fucking terrible.

221
00:13:26,055 --> 00:13:27,515
But it's happened.

222
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:33,145
And you said yourself, you're dying.

223
00:13:33,938 --> 00:13:38,609
So we came to... to ask you,
since you don't have anyone...

224
00:13:38,692 --> 00:13:40,986
Who says I don't have anyone?

225
00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:42,905
- Well, do you?
- I might.

226
00:13:44,281 --> 00:13:47,159
- What if I love somebody?
- Well, whoever she is...

227
00:13:47,243 --> 00:13:48,661
Maybe it's a he.

228
00:13:48,744 --> 00:13:50,830
Whatever. I...

229
00:13:50,913 --> 00:13:52,581
I don't care what they are.

230
00:13:52,665 --> 00:13:55,376
If you have someone,
you haven't had them for long.

231
00:13:55,459 --> 00:13:57,461
And we're your family, Will.

232
00:13:59,046 --> 00:14:00,881
Maybe not the best family, but...

233
00:14:02,174 --> 00:14:03,300
here we are.

234
00:14:04,301 --> 00:14:05,594
And whatever Mum left you,

235
00:14:07,221 --> 00:14:08,597
it should go to us.

236
00:14:17,731 --> 00:14:18,816
You're right.

237
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:23,237
My life didn't amount to much.

238
00:14:24,154 --> 00:14:26,574
I never loved anybody who loved me back.

239
00:14:30,369 --> 00:14:32,121
Whatever Mum left me is yours.

240
00:14:32,788 --> 00:14:34,582
I won't touch a penny of it.

241
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:46,427
We needed 1,000 bombs for Staircase.

242
00:14:46,510 --> 00:14:49,096
We've got just over 300.
We're not getting any more.

243
00:14:50,389 --> 00:14:53,726
The smallest hibernation rig
I can supply weighs over a ton.

244
00:14:53,809 --> 00:14:56,437
If we want to accelerate the probe
to the required speed,

245
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:58,522
with the propellant available to us...

246
00:14:58,606 --> 00:15:01,984
The heaviest payload it can carry
is under two kilograms.

247
00:15:02,067 --> 00:15:03,944
That's a very small person.

248
00:15:05,529 --> 00:15:08,198
I would say a person is
the ever-changing pattern

249
00:15:08,282 --> 00:15:10,242
dancing through the neurons
of their brain.

250
00:15:10,326 --> 00:15:12,578
If that exists, the person exists.

251
00:15:13,871 --> 00:15:17,583
We would, however, have to remove
that brain from their skull.

252
00:15:18,167 --> 00:15:19,960
It'll be enough for them
to rebuild the rest.

253
00:15:20,044 --> 00:15:22,630
If they do, we have a man on the inside.

254
00:15:22,713 --> 00:15:24,793
Sorry. Are we talking about
killing someone for this?

255
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:26,508
And we weren't before?

256
00:15:32,806 --> 00:15:34,433
San-Ti.

257
00:15:34,516 --> 00:15:35,893
Hello out there.

258
00:15:36,810 --> 00:15:37,686
In here.

259
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:40,147
Wherever your Sophons may be.

260
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:42,483
You've read Wikipedia.

261
00:15:43,275 --> 00:15:46,862
You know all about Genghis Khan,
QAnon and <i>The Tale of Genji</i>

262
00:15:46,946 --> 00:15:48,739
and the President of Bolivia
and Bob Seger,

263
00:15:48,822 --> 00:15:51,158
but you don't know
what it feels like to be us.

264
00:15:51,659 --> 00:15:53,077
All that we are is up here.

265
00:15:54,244 --> 00:15:57,665
What's going on up here
and here, that's humanity.

266
00:15:57,748 --> 00:15:59,333
You want to understand us?

267
00:15:59,416 --> 00:16:03,629
You'll need to get your hands or tentacles
or whatever the fuck appendages you have

268
00:16:03,712 --> 00:16:04,964
on the thing itself.

269
00:16:05,047 --> 00:16:06,966
Don't worry. We'll send you someone smart.

270
00:16:07,049 --> 00:16:10,844
You need someone who actually understands
the people who make decisions around here.

271
00:16:10,928 --> 00:16:14,765
Someone who can learn about you.
Someone like the people in this room.

272
00:16:20,187 --> 00:16:21,187
What about it?

273
00:16:22,898 --> 00:16:23,774
I'll go.

274
00:16:23,857 --> 00:16:24,900
- Who are you?
- Edgar.

275
00:16:24,984 --> 00:16:27,528
Don't be a retard, Edgar.
I'm talking about serious people.

276
00:16:28,362 --> 00:16:29,947
What about it, serious people?

277
00:16:30,030 --> 00:16:32,282
Who wants to meet the enemy? Hmm?

278
00:16:34,743 --> 00:16:36,787
Hmm? Course not.

279
00:16:36,870 --> 00:16:38,831
You have too much to lose.
You don't wanna go.

280
00:16:38,914 --> 00:16:41,083
And I wouldn't let you.
You're all too valuable.

281
00:16:41,166 --> 00:16:45,504
But we need someone who knows
about physics, chemistry, rocket science.

282
00:16:45,587 --> 00:16:48,424
Someone who's willing to die.
Likely for nothing.

283
00:16:48,507 --> 00:16:50,968
Which probably means
someone who's dying already.

284
00:16:53,095 --> 00:16:55,347
Any of you know
someone of that description?

285
00:17:01,687 --> 00:17:03,188
It's fucking barbaric.

286
00:17:03,897 --> 00:17:05,566
We need the Staircase Project.

287
00:17:05,649 --> 00:17:07,776
Propulsion, cryogenics, material sciences...

288
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:10,279
It'll shoot us forward
two generations in all of them,

289
00:17:10,362 --> 00:17:12,031
even if it's a failure.

290
00:17:12,114 --> 00:17:14,575
But we need a reason
for the project to exist,

291
00:17:14,658 --> 00:17:15,868
and the person inside...

292
00:17:15,951 --> 00:17:17,161
The severed fucking head.

293
00:17:17,244 --> 00:17:19,163
The person inside is that reason.

294
00:17:19,246 --> 00:17:20,998
Your friend Will is that reason.

295
00:17:21,081 --> 00:17:24,209
And if they find him, he can learn about
things we wouldn't know otherwise

296
00:17:24,293 --> 00:17:26,879
before they get here and it's too late.

297
00:17:26,962 --> 00:17:28,547
Only advance.

298
00:17:28,630 --> 00:17:31,800
"Only advance"? What kind
of Magic Eight-Ball shit is that?

299
00:17:31,884 --> 00:17:34,645
It doesn't matter what Will learns.
How could he tell anyone about it?

300
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,013
He seems a smart enough fella.

301
00:17:36,096 --> 00:17:37,376
They're listening to everything.

302
00:17:37,431 --> 00:17:39,641
You can't outsmart them.
You can't plot against them.

303
00:17:39,725 --> 00:17:40,559
Maybe he can.

304
00:17:40,642 --> 00:17:43,353
- No, he can't. That's not who he is.
- I'll chat with him anyway.

305
00:17:43,437 --> 00:17:45,757
Who knows what's going on
in that svelte three-pound brain.

306
00:17:45,814 --> 00:17:48,150
Not you. You don't know him.

307
00:17:48,233 --> 00:17:50,819
That's right. Neither do you.
Or the San-Ti.

308
00:17:50,903 --> 00:17:53,447
Only Will Downing
truly knows Will Downing.

309
00:17:58,035 --> 00:17:59,119
What?

310
00:18:01,246 --> 00:18:03,123
I'm thinking of a number
between one and 1,000.

311
00:18:03,207 --> 00:18:04,416
Do you know what it is?

312
00:18:05,542 --> 00:18:07,503
- No.
- That's right. You don't.

313
00:18:08,962 --> 00:18:10,214
Neither do they.

314
00:18:10,297 --> 00:18:11,632
I have to make a call.

315
00:18:11,715 --> 00:18:13,075
You can't force him into it.

316
00:18:13,133 --> 00:18:15,135
He'd be no use to us if I did.

317
00:18:15,219 --> 00:18:18,097
- We're gonna tell him not to do it.
- You do that.

318
00:18:24,311 --> 00:18:26,191
We'll tell him not to do it.
He'll listen to us.

319
00:18:26,230 --> 00:18:28,857
He'll listen to <i>you.</i> You don't need me.

320
00:18:29,691 --> 00:18:31,568
- Of course I need you.
- I can't stay.

321
00:18:32,736 --> 00:18:36,073
I never should have come to work
for that man. For any of these men.

322
00:18:36,156 --> 00:18:38,742
I fucked up. I need to fix it.

323
00:18:39,952 --> 00:18:40,994
I'm leaving.

324
00:18:45,833 --> 00:18:48,168
So long, boss.

325
00:18:52,548 --> 00:18:53,799
It's Wade.

326
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:56,800
<i>How can I help you, Mr. Wade?</i>

327
00:18:56,844 --> 00:18:59,972
I have a new project that's going
to require everyone's participation.

328
00:19:00,055 --> 00:19:00,889
Everyone.

329
00:19:00,973 --> 00:19:03,976
I want you to spearhead this project
and bring them all into line.

330
00:19:04,059 --> 00:19:05,435
<i>I'm very busy, Mr. Wade.</i>

331
00:19:05,519 --> 00:19:07,813
Yes. These are busy times.

332
00:19:13,193 --> 00:19:14,903
<i>Tell me about your project.</i>

333
00:19:16,697 --> 00:19:19,491
Have you ever heard the term "Wallfacer"?

334
00:19:37,009 --> 00:19:38,135
Ah.

335
00:19:39,803 --> 00:19:42,014
Heart Snatcher, innit?

336
00:19:42,097 --> 00:19:46,226
You're just button-mashing.
Got to learn some combos.

337
00:19:47,269 --> 00:19:48,269
Hmm.

338
00:19:50,022 --> 00:19:51,022
What's up?

339
00:19:59,573 --> 00:20:01,283
What's "The Great Escape"?

340
00:20:02,284 --> 00:20:05,245
It's my business. Mine and Ally's.

341
00:20:06,038 --> 00:20:08,832
It's legit.
We set up a private limited company.

342
00:20:08,916 --> 00:20:11,501
How'd you do that?
Some lawyers take your money?

343
00:20:11,585 --> 00:20:14,087
A guy on YouTube explained it.
Just go on the website.

344
00:20:15,047 --> 00:20:16,465
We're working on a deck.

345
00:20:16,548 --> 00:20:19,343
"A safe future
for your descendants on Mars

346
00:20:19,426 --> 00:20:22,095
or other habitable planets."

347
00:20:22,179 --> 00:20:24,723
And branding concepts
on the next page.

348
00:20:26,892 --> 00:20:27,892
That's, um...

349
00:20:28,894 --> 00:20:30,103
That design's pretty good.

350
00:20:30,187 --> 00:20:31,855
Classy, right?

351
00:20:31,939 --> 00:20:33,023
Uh-huh.

352
00:20:33,774 --> 00:20:38,237
How's someone going to escape
into outer space for 40 quid a month?

353
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:39,613
It's like a pension account.

354
00:20:39,696 --> 00:20:42,216
Put in money every month,
and that grows and creates more money.

355
00:20:42,241 --> 00:20:45,035
So the next month, there's
an even bigger pile of money growing.

356
00:20:45,118 --> 00:20:47,079
And, you know, do the maths.

357
00:20:47,955 --> 00:20:50,916
- Did you do the maths?
- Working on setting up meetings.

358
00:20:50,999 --> 00:20:53,585
There's a guy named Denys Porlock
who's interested.

359
00:20:53,669 --> 00:20:56,213
He's legit. Look him up. Denys with a Y.

360
00:20:57,005 --> 00:21:00,133
This is impressive, Reg,
that you've done this all on your own.

361
00:21:01,843 --> 00:21:02,843
I'm impressed.

362
00:21:03,595 --> 00:21:05,264
Yeah?

363
00:21:12,145 --> 00:21:13,272
But it is bollocks.

364
00:21:15,107 --> 00:21:16,400
It's not real.

365
00:21:17,943 --> 00:21:19,361
So help me make it real.

366
00:21:24,116 --> 00:21:25,742
I don't know how.

367
00:21:29,371 --> 00:21:33,417
So, this, all of this, is this real?

368
00:21:34,376 --> 00:21:37,087
Because if this is what real is,
I'm not interested.

369
00:21:49,599 --> 00:21:52,894
{\an8}In any case,
in the new world we're living in,

370
00:21:52,978 --> 00:21:55,439
{\an8}I'm afraid I can't afford
to wait any longer.

371
00:21:56,982 --> 00:21:59,818
I wanted to tell you in person.
I feel I owe you that.

372
00:22:00,861 --> 00:22:02,696
I appreciate it, Denys. Thank you.

373
00:22:02,779 --> 00:22:06,283
Surely you understand that.
I have no choice in the matter.

374
00:22:07,117 --> 00:22:08,827
We all have choices.

375
00:22:11,496 --> 00:22:13,957
I've never been less happy
about a business decision,

376
00:22:14,041 --> 00:22:16,501
but the potential for future applications...

377
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:20,839
I'm doing what I have to do.

378
00:22:25,469 --> 00:22:27,512
By all means, finish your tweet.

379
00:22:27,596 --> 00:22:29,389
Just doing what <i>I</i> have to do.

380
00:22:30,307 --> 00:22:32,351
What I should've been doing all along.

381
00:22:32,434 --> 00:22:34,561
And I'm taking my work with me.

382
00:22:35,228 --> 00:22:36,730
It doesn't belong to you, Auggie.

383
00:22:38,607 --> 00:22:39,607
It doesn't.

384
00:22:40,776 --> 00:22:41,943
It shouldn't, right?

385
00:22:42,027 --> 00:22:44,905
It can make life better
for the people who need it most.

386
00:22:44,988 --> 00:22:46,865
It shouldn't belong to anybody.

387
00:22:47,491 --> 00:22:49,284
It should belong to everybody.

388
00:22:49,368 --> 00:22:50,994
I'm afraid that's not how it works.

389
00:22:51,078 --> 00:22:52,621
It does if I give it to them.

390
00:22:53,705 --> 00:22:55,665
All of our research,
the specs on our equipment,

391
00:22:55,749 --> 00:22:57,793
our work on upscaling and applications,

392
00:22:58,710 --> 00:23:02,381
{\an8}all on Wikileaks and arXiv
and a dozen other open-source platforms.

393
00:23:03,590 --> 00:23:04,508
You wouldn't.

394
00:23:04,591 --> 00:23:05,842
I just did.

395
00:23:15,477 --> 00:23:16,728
No one can use it.

396
00:23:17,479 --> 00:23:19,791
It belongs to the company,
and our investors will sue them.

397
00:23:19,815 --> 00:23:23,235
Well, they can use clean room design,
separate their designers from your IP,

398
00:23:23,318 --> 00:23:25,862
and cover their asses
against copyright infringement.

399
00:23:25,946 --> 00:23:27,572
I threw in a guide for that too.

400
00:23:28,490 --> 00:23:29,658
It... it won't work.

401
00:23:29,741 --> 00:23:32,494
Worked against IBM.
Worked against Apple. Worked against Sony.

402
00:23:32,577 --> 00:23:35,080
But go ahead. Sue everyone.

403
00:23:35,163 --> 00:23:37,290
Sue all the governments
of the developing world.

404
00:23:37,374 --> 00:23:38,792
That'll make you popular.

405
00:23:38,875 --> 00:23:40,627
Maybe I'll just start with you.

406
00:23:42,712 --> 00:23:44,214
You'll end up in prison.

407
00:23:44,297 --> 00:23:46,967
Well, they better arrest me fast.
My flight leaves in three hours.

408
00:23:47,050 --> 00:23:50,262
So that's your plan
for your life's work? For your life?

409
00:23:50,345 --> 00:23:52,681
Burn it all down and go and get drunk?

410
00:23:54,808 --> 00:23:55,808
It's not for me.

411
00:23:58,270 --> 00:23:59,270
But...

412
00:24:03,567 --> 00:24:05,527
And that's what she got you, huh?

413
00:24:05,610 --> 00:24:06,611
Yeah.

414
00:24:07,529 --> 00:24:11,158
Did she, um... say where she was going?

415
00:24:11,241 --> 00:24:12,241
No.

416
00:24:14,578 --> 00:24:15,954
So it's all real, then?

417
00:24:19,332 --> 00:24:20,584
- Yeah.
- Fuck.

418
00:24:20,667 --> 00:24:23,795
What's it called again,
Stairway to Heaven?

419
00:24:23,879 --> 00:24:26,131
The Staircase Project. Yeah.

420
00:24:26,214 --> 00:24:27,674
Doesn't sound real.

421
00:24:27,757 --> 00:24:29,426
None of it sounds real.

422
00:24:29,509 --> 00:24:31,803
Big Eye in the Sky calling us all bugs.

423
00:24:31,887 --> 00:24:33,263
It's science fiction.

424
00:24:33,346 --> 00:24:34,473
Mm.

425
00:24:34,556 --> 00:24:35,849
Fairy tales.

426
00:24:42,105 --> 00:24:43,940
- You still have that?
- Of course.

427
00:24:45,942 --> 00:24:47,194
When did I give it to you?

428
00:24:47,277 --> 00:24:50,697
June 10, 2015,
four days after my birthday.

429
00:24:56,786 --> 00:25:00,665
So, uh, who would this Staircase Project
turn me into?

430
00:25:01,333 --> 00:25:04,711
Maybe some kind of
a <i>Sleeping Beauty</i> character?

431
00:25:09,382 --> 00:25:11,218
Anyway, it's simple.

432
00:25:11,301 --> 00:25:13,220
You tell Wade you're not gonna do it.

433
00:25:14,262 --> 00:25:16,223
1% of light speed?

434
00:25:17,098 --> 00:25:19,226
That's almost 2,000 miles per second.

435
00:25:20,519 --> 00:25:22,020
You always worked big.

436
00:25:22,729 --> 00:25:24,481
No, I didn't come up with it.

437
00:25:24,564 --> 00:25:26,107
I just got the math right.

438
00:25:26,191 --> 00:25:27,984
Oh, that's all.

439
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:31,029
But it would be an amazing accomplishment.

440
00:25:33,323 --> 00:25:35,909
A historic accomplishment.

441
00:25:36,785 --> 00:25:37,785
Yeah.

442
00:25:38,662 --> 00:25:39,788
Yeah, it would.

443
00:25:41,873 --> 00:25:45,085
But you don't have to worry about that
because we're gonna find someone else.

444
00:25:45,168 --> 00:25:46,336
Who else have you got?

445
00:25:46,419 --> 00:25:47,504
We have options.

446
00:25:48,421 --> 00:25:50,924
I know my main qualification
is that I'm dying,

447
00:25:51,007 --> 00:25:53,802
but you can't just send anyone.

448
00:25:53,885 --> 00:25:54,885
So...

449
00:25:55,554 --> 00:25:56,638
who else is there?

450
00:25:56,721 --> 00:25:58,598
I'm afraid that's classified.

451
00:25:58,682 --> 00:26:00,600
And everything else you've told me isn't?

452
00:26:00,684 --> 00:26:02,561
I'm not supposed to talk about it.

453
00:26:05,564 --> 00:26:07,274
You haven't got anyone.

454
00:26:08,733 --> 00:26:13,280
Well, if you don't have a passenger,
it doesn't really work then, does it?

455
00:26:29,963 --> 00:26:31,548
You always worked big.

456
00:26:32,882 --> 00:26:33,882
I couldn't.

457
00:26:33,925 --> 00:26:35,677
I wanted to, but I couldn't.

458
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:37,804
- I just didn't have the equipment.
- Stop it.

459
00:26:37,887 --> 00:26:40,390
It's all right.
I've made my peace with it.

460
00:26:42,267 --> 00:26:43,893
But now we could both work big.

461
00:26:44,811 --> 00:26:46,021
Not like this.

462
00:26:50,191 --> 00:26:51,359
What?

463
00:26:52,068 --> 00:26:53,862
Why are you staring at me?

464
00:26:55,238 --> 00:26:56,239
I'm not.

465
00:26:57,991 --> 00:26:59,367
I'm seeing you.

466
00:27:03,038 --> 00:27:07,250
Sometimes, when you're really high,
you see people.

467
00:27:09,419 --> 00:27:11,338
Or maybe it's when you're dying.

468
00:27:14,841 --> 00:27:16,092
But I see you.

469
00:27:20,555 --> 00:27:21,765
And I love you.

470
00:27:27,812 --> 00:27:28,938
And it's all right.

471
00:27:38,615 --> 00:27:40,575
Tell me not to do it, and I won't.

472
00:27:48,750 --> 00:27:49,750
It's all right.

473
00:29:00,530 --> 00:29:01,865
It's Dr. Ye.

474
00:29:03,658 --> 00:29:05,660
I know you don't want to see me.

475
00:29:07,412 --> 00:29:09,247
But I need to speak with you.

476
00:29:23,595 --> 00:29:24,721
He's lost.

477
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:28,266
What do you care? He's a bug.

478
00:29:33,229 --> 00:29:34,814
Vera knew what you did.

479
00:29:36,524 --> 00:29:37,901
She knew you called them here.

480
00:29:42,697 --> 00:29:46,493
It never made sense,
her killing herself over the work.

481
00:29:47,118 --> 00:29:51,998
She must have come across, I don't know,
an email or text or something.

482
00:29:52,916 --> 00:29:54,417
And she started digging.

483
00:29:55,043 --> 00:29:57,837
She always said you were the smartest one.

484
00:29:59,005 --> 00:30:00,924
I tried to hide it from her.

485
00:30:01,674 --> 00:30:04,219
I wanted to protect her, but I couldn't.

486
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:06,888
She was smart like you.

487
00:30:08,056 --> 00:30:09,641
She figured things out.

488
00:30:11,684 --> 00:30:12,684
You failed her.

489
00:30:13,478 --> 00:30:16,064
I failed more people than anyone ever.

490
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:19,025
How can you live with it?

491
00:30:19,776 --> 00:30:21,778
I won't have to much longer.

492
00:30:25,573 --> 00:30:29,452
Why weren't you running
your own lab instead of working at Vera's?

493
00:30:30,662 --> 00:30:33,498
I was good at physics,
but I never loved it.

494
00:30:34,582 --> 00:30:36,382
I suppose that's why
I never amounted to much.

495
00:30:36,417 --> 00:30:39,754
In the end,
we all amount to about the same.

496
00:30:42,632 --> 00:30:44,843
Would you like to hear a joke?

497
00:30:54,769 --> 00:30:56,563
So, Einstein dies.

498
00:30:57,146 --> 00:31:01,150
He finds himself in heaven,
and he has his violin.

499
00:31:01,234 --> 00:31:04,362
He's overjoyed. He loves his violin.

500
00:31:04,445 --> 00:31:06,239
More than physics.

501
00:31:06,322 --> 00:31:07,782
Even more than women.

502
00:31:08,658 --> 00:31:12,245
He's excited to find out
how well he can play in heaven.

503
00:31:12,328 --> 00:31:15,290
He imagines he'll be pretty damn good.

504
00:31:15,373 --> 00:31:18,877
So he starts tuning up,
and the angels rush at him.

505
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:20,795
"What are you doing?" they say.

506
00:31:20,879 --> 00:31:22,839
"I'm getting ready to play."

507
00:31:22,922 --> 00:31:26,009
"Don't do that. God won't like it."

508
00:31:26,092 --> 00:31:27,635
"He's a saxophonist."

509
00:31:27,719 --> 00:31:30,013
So Einstein stops.

510
00:31:30,555 --> 00:31:33,182
He doesn't play, but it's difficult.

511
00:31:33,266 --> 00:31:37,896
He loves music, and there's actually
not much to do in heaven.

512
00:31:39,022 --> 00:31:43,693
And sure enough,
from high above, he hears a saxophone.

513
00:31:43,776 --> 00:31:46,362
It's playing "Take the A Train."
Do you know that one?

514
00:31:46,446 --> 00:31:47,947
Yeah. I mean, I've heard it.

515
00:31:48,448 --> 00:31:50,992
Einstein knows it too. And he thinks,

516
00:31:51,659 --> 00:31:55,496
"I'm going to do it.
I'm going to play with Him."

517
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:57,957
"We're going to sound great together."

518
00:31:58,499 --> 00:32:01,210
So he starts playing "Take the A Train."

519
00:32:02,045 --> 00:32:05,173
The saxophone stops, and God appears.

520
00:32:05,256 --> 00:32:08,426
He marches over to Einstein
and kicks him in the balls,

521
00:32:08,509 --> 00:32:10,136
which hurts, even in heaven.

522
00:32:10,219 --> 00:32:14,891
Then he smashes
Einstein's beloved violin to bits.

523
00:32:14,974 --> 00:32:17,226
Eternity without music.

524
00:32:17,310 --> 00:32:19,854
Heaven has become hell for Einstein.

525
00:32:19,938 --> 00:32:24,817
And, as he writhes on the ground,
holding his smashed balls,

526
00:32:24,901 --> 00:32:30,031
an angel comes over
and says, "We warned you."

527
00:32:30,114 --> 00:32:33,117
"Never play with God."

528
00:32:41,292 --> 00:32:42,835
"Never play with God"?

529
00:32:43,628 --> 00:32:45,129
You don't like it?

530
00:32:45,213 --> 00:32:47,215
No, it's... it's not that. It's just...

531
00:32:48,967 --> 00:32:50,718
"Never play with God."

532
00:32:53,304 --> 00:32:56,891
Humor is a very personal thing.

533
00:32:57,433 --> 00:33:00,687
Some people understand it,
and some people don't.

534
00:33:02,146 --> 00:33:06,401
Some jokes are so private,
they only make sense to two people.

535
00:33:07,819 --> 00:33:09,862
But jokes are important.

536
00:33:11,406 --> 00:33:14,242
We wouldn't survive without them.

537
00:33:17,620 --> 00:33:18,788
Don't you agree?

538
00:33:26,462 --> 00:33:27,672
I have to go.

539
00:33:28,923 --> 00:33:30,383
Take care, Saul.

540
00:33:31,050 --> 00:33:33,678
I hope my joke
doesn't cause you any trouble.

541
00:33:48,693 --> 00:33:52,321
Well, your test scores are good,
both cognitive and informational.

542
00:33:52,405 --> 00:33:53,698
No surprise there.

543
00:33:53,781 --> 00:33:55,450
One last thing,

544
00:33:55,533 --> 00:33:58,036
a... formality.

545
00:33:59,287 --> 00:34:00,413
A loyalty oath.

546
00:34:01,664 --> 00:34:03,082
We need you to sign it.

547
00:34:06,669 --> 00:34:09,422
"Henceforth, I swear all my endeavors

548
00:34:09,505 --> 00:34:13,051
shall be to affirm
my loyalty to the human race,

549
00:34:13,134 --> 00:34:17,430
now and into perpetuity,
superseding all other loyalties."

550
00:34:17,513 --> 00:34:20,349
"I shall never knowingly perform any act

551
00:34:21,059 --> 00:34:26,731
or divulge any information that might
cause harm to humanity as a whole."

552
00:34:30,443 --> 00:34:31,736
No. I won't sign that.

553
00:34:32,904 --> 00:34:33,821
Why not?

554
00:34:33,905 --> 00:34:36,991
Because I don't feel
any loyalty to the human race.

555
00:34:37,575 --> 00:34:39,494
So why are you doing this?

556
00:34:39,577 --> 00:34:41,496
Well, I'm dying anyway, right?

557
00:34:42,038 --> 00:34:43,164
Who knows?

558
00:34:43,247 --> 00:34:45,750
They might end up being better than us.

559
00:34:46,584 --> 00:34:49,003
Why would I swear loyalty to us

560
00:34:49,587 --> 00:34:51,798
if they could end up being better?

561
00:34:53,257 --> 00:34:54,592
They're invading us.

562
00:34:54,675 --> 00:34:57,970
They're coming to conquer us.
Most likely wipe us out.

563
00:34:59,138 --> 00:35:00,223
So they say.

564
00:35:00,848 --> 00:35:02,767
And you don't want
to help us prevent that?

565
00:35:03,434 --> 00:35:05,103
Jin thinks it's what I should do.

566
00:35:05,686 --> 00:35:06,979
And I trust her.

567
00:35:07,688 --> 00:35:11,317
If you want me to sign
a loyalty oath to her, then I will.

568
00:35:12,276 --> 00:35:13,903
But to humanity?

569
00:35:15,154 --> 00:35:16,154
No.

570
00:35:25,289 --> 00:35:27,834
Thank you for your time, Mr. Downing.

571
00:35:32,922 --> 00:35:34,799
You're perfect for the Staircase Project.

572
00:35:34,882 --> 00:35:37,218
We'll be in touch shortly
regarding next steps.

573
00:35:41,889 --> 00:35:42,890
Hey!

574
00:35:44,642 --> 00:35:47,103
Why's he perfect for the project?
He wouldn't sign the oath.

575
00:35:47,186 --> 00:35:48,980
He's our man because he's not our man.

576
00:35:49,981 --> 00:35:51,023
He really might not be.

577
00:35:51,107 --> 00:35:52,859
I know. He really might not be.

578
00:35:52,942 --> 00:35:55,611
That's why they'll go out of their way
to pick him up.

579
00:36:20,595 --> 00:36:23,431
<i>This year's cicada swarm

581
00:36:26,309 --> 00:36:28,728
<i>- Just like a magic cream.

582
00:36:28,811 --> 00:36:31,606
<i>Yeah, it works really well

583
00:36:31,689 --> 00:36:34,025

00:36:35,735 --> 00:36:37,570

<i>Hello, Tatiana.</i>

587
00:36:48,289 --> 00:36:50,750
I heard you were done speaking to us.

588
00:36:53,127 --> 00:36:55,004
They said you let Evans die.

589
00:36:55,630 --> 00:36:57,840
<i>We were done speaking to him.</i>

590
00:36:57,924 --> 00:37:00,259
<i>But we are not done speaking to you.</i>

591
00:37:01,761 --> 00:37:03,304
What... what am I?

592
00:37:05,139 --> 00:37:06,307
I'm nothing.

593
00:37:08,309 --> 00:37:09,352
A bug.

594
00:37:10,102 --> 00:37:11,646
<i>We know exactly what you are.</i>

595
00:37:12,605 --> 00:37:15,942
<i>You are a part of something
much larger than yourself.</i>

596
00:37:16,734 --> 00:37:17,985
<i>You are a part of us.</i>

597
00:37:19,528 --> 00:37:20,780
<i>And we need you.</i>

598
00:37:32,458 --> 00:37:35,169
<i>Cathay Pacific departure to Beijing,</i>

601
00:38:01,153 --> 00:38:04,198
Hello. I'm Dr. Ye.

602
00:38:07,576 --> 00:38:08,703
Sorry. Do I know you?

603
00:38:09,745 --> 00:38:12,581
I changed my seat
so we could sit together.

604
00:38:12,665 --> 00:38:14,458
I hope you don't mind.

605
00:38:15,918 --> 00:38:18,421
It will be nice
to have someone to talk to.

606
00:38:22,383 --> 00:38:24,635
Yeah. It's a long flight.

607
00:38:31,934 --> 00:38:37,440
So, Mr. Downing, you have to consent
to the procedure five times.

608
00:38:37,523 --> 00:38:42,653
The questions are designed to avoid
the possibility of accidental consent.

609
00:38:44,447 --> 00:38:46,240
Take as much time as you need.

610
00:38:47,533 --> 00:38:48,826
Thank you.

611
00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:58,961
This place, it's, uh...

612
00:38:59,795 --> 00:39:00,795
It's nice.

613
00:39:01,255 --> 00:39:02,465
Yeah.

614
00:39:09,055 --> 00:39:10,306
Jin, um...

615
00:39:10,389 --> 00:39:12,058
I told her not to come.

616
00:39:18,105 --> 00:39:19,815
I'm off to Cape Canaveral.

617
00:39:20,566 --> 00:39:22,651
The first ICBM launches are on Friday.

618
00:39:22,735 --> 00:39:25,154
There and in Baikonur and Jiuquan.

619
00:39:25,237 --> 00:39:27,823
The Staircase bombs
will be in place in a few weeks,

620
00:39:27,907 --> 00:39:30,701
and we'll be ready to send
our volunteer on his journey.

621
00:39:31,494 --> 00:39:32,828
Exciting days.

622
00:39:35,748 --> 00:39:36,957
I'll leave you to it.

623
00:39:37,750 --> 00:39:41,754
Oh. I keep forgetting to ask...
did you get a chance to thank him?

624
00:39:41,837 --> 00:39:42,963
In person, I mean.

625
00:39:45,007 --> 00:39:46,384
For your star.

626
00:39:50,179 --> 00:39:51,764
Will gave me the star?

627
00:39:52,723 --> 00:39:54,600
Oh, he didn't tell you.

628
00:39:54,683 --> 00:39:56,477
Yeah, he inherited some money.

629
00:39:57,228 --> 00:39:59,355
It's a worthless piece of paper.

630
00:39:59,855 --> 00:40:02,817
Drop your price and resell it,
or you'll be left with nothing.

631
00:40:07,488 --> 00:40:10,991
- It wasn't. It was the King's Arms.
- No, it was the Eagle and Child.

632
00:40:11,075 --> 00:40:12,618
I'm tellin' you. 'Cause that's when...

633
00:40:12,701 --> 00:40:14,995
Listen. You were talking
to that blonde Christian chick,

634
00:40:15,079 --> 00:40:18,207
who was getting ready
to get very unchristian with you,

635
00:40:18,290 --> 00:40:21,710
until you told her that you thought
C.S. Lewis was a shitty writer.

636
00:40:21,794 --> 00:40:23,796
Oh. And she thought it was disrespectful

637
00:40:23,879 --> 00:40:26,882
because we were in the room
where Lewis used to drink with Tolkien.

638
00:40:26,966 --> 00:40:28,235
- Okay, you're right.
- Thank you.

639
00:40:28,259 --> 00:40:29,760
It was the Eagle and Child.

640
00:40:30,511 --> 00:40:32,012
And he was a shitty writer.

641
00:40:46,277 --> 00:40:47,278
Well...

642
00:40:48,696 --> 00:40:50,531
I'm not getting any younger.

643
00:40:56,203 --> 00:40:57,037
Will.

644
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:08,299
Okay, but... Seriously...

645
00:41:12,094 --> 00:41:15,139
You need to think this through,
what it means.

646
00:41:15,222 --> 00:41:18,434
You're floating in endless, frozen space.

647
00:41:18,976 --> 00:41:21,770
Not alive, and... and not dead.

648
00:41:23,022 --> 00:41:26,233
Maybe for thousands of years.
Maybe forever.

649
00:41:26,317 --> 00:41:28,944
And completely unaware the whole time.

650
00:41:29,028 --> 00:41:32,823
So, basically dead, which is
what I was gonna be soon anyways.

651
00:41:36,243 --> 00:41:38,043
No, Will, that's...

652
00:41:38,120 --> 00:41:40,498
That's best-case scenario.

653
00:41:40,998 --> 00:41:43,083
'Cause if they find you,
they'll rebuild you.

654
00:41:43,792 --> 00:41:46,420
And maybe... maybe they just...
they turn you into a program,

655
00:41:46,504 --> 00:41:49,048
and they communicate with you
through an interface.

656
00:41:49,131 --> 00:41:52,468
You can't see. You can't...
You can't hear. You can't feel.

657
00:41:52,551 --> 00:41:55,971
Like an isolation tank.
Question goes in, answer comes out.

658
00:41:56,055 --> 00:41:57,306
Whether you like it or not.

659
00:41:57,932 --> 00:41:59,517
They just read your mind.

660
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:01,685
So they read <i>Diary of a Nobody.</i>

661
00:42:02,478 --> 00:42:04,730
Then they switch me off,
and we're back to dead.

662
00:42:09,485 --> 00:42:13,155
Okay, but... maybe
it's not an isolation tank.

663
00:42:14,657 --> 00:42:18,285
Will, they want to know everything
about what it means to be a human being.

664
00:42:18,369 --> 00:42:21,997
And maybe the only way for them
to do that is to interact with you.

665
00:42:23,082 --> 00:42:24,458
So they bring you back.

666
00:42:25,876 --> 00:42:27,753
They run experiments on you to learn

667
00:42:29,004 --> 00:42:30,756
how we experience things.

668
00:42:30,839 --> 00:42:33,551
- What makes us happy.
- That's starting to sound pretty good.

669
00:42:33,634 --> 00:42:35,386
What makes us unhappy.

670
00:42:37,721 --> 00:42:41,600
What makes us so unhappy
that it could be used against us.

671
00:42:42,351 --> 00:42:44,061
How do we feel exhaustion?

672
00:42:44,144 --> 00:42:46,146
How do we feel fear?

673
00:42:46,230 --> 00:42:48,148
How do we feel pain?

674
00:42:48,232 --> 00:42:49,400
How do we suffer?

675
00:42:50,109 --> 00:42:52,111
How much can we take?

676
00:42:52,194 --> 00:42:53,946
They can do whatever they want to you.

677
00:42:54,029 --> 00:42:57,533
They can push you to the limit
and past it, but you don't get to die.

678
00:42:58,993 --> 00:43:00,786
If you do,
they'll just bring you back again.

679
00:43:00,869 --> 00:43:02,955
And they can do that for a month.

680
00:43:03,038 --> 00:43:06,584
They can do that for a century.
They can do that for 10,000 years.

681
00:43:06,667 --> 00:43:08,669
Saul, why would they do that?

682
00:43:08,752 --> 00:43:11,255
I don't... I don't fuckin' know. I...

683
00:43:12,006 --> 00:43:13,882
We don't know what they are.

684
00:43:15,259 --> 00:43:17,094
And maybe we can't know what they are.

685
00:43:17,886 --> 00:43:20,180
But compared to us,
it's exactly what they told us.

686
00:43:20,264 --> 00:43:21,640
We are bugs.

687
00:43:23,934 --> 00:43:27,146
Bugs don't know why terrible things
happen to them. They're bugs.

688
00:43:27,813 --> 00:43:30,899
Right? Maybe it's an exterminator.
Maybe it's a science class.

689
00:43:30,983 --> 00:43:34,695
Maybe it's just some nasty little kid
that's ripping their legs off for fun.

690
00:43:36,196 --> 00:43:37,615
Don't try to figure it out.

691
00:43:38,991 --> 00:43:40,576
You just stay away from them.

692
00:43:56,383 --> 00:43:57,801
How many was that?

693
00:43:57,885 --> 00:43:58,969
That's four.

694
00:44:02,681 --> 00:44:04,558
The next one is the last one.

695
00:44:06,685 --> 00:44:08,562
Maybe it won't be as bad as all that.

696
00:44:08,646 --> 00:44:11,482
Maybe it would be like, um...
Like I'm a pet to them.

697
00:44:14,234 --> 00:44:16,737
Or maybe I'll be like entertainment.

698
00:44:20,908 --> 00:44:22,618
What do you do for entertainment?

699
00:44:24,370 --> 00:44:26,038
What's your favorite movie?

700
00:44:27,998 --> 00:44:29,208
<i>The Shining.</i>

701
00:44:43,472 --> 00:44:45,683
How many people get this opportunity?

702
00:44:50,521 --> 00:44:52,940
To say a proper goodbye to a good friend.

703
00:44:55,567 --> 00:44:56,694
Not many.

704
00:45:02,199 --> 00:45:03,909
I never had many friends.

705
00:45:04,993 --> 00:45:08,622
But thanks to you guys,
always felt like enough.

706
00:45:14,670 --> 00:45:17,423
Will, I'm...
I'm gonna miss you, man.

707
00:45:26,348 --> 00:45:27,349
Good.

708
00:45:30,769 --> 00:45:33,272
If they bring me back, I'll miss you too.

709
00:48:31,241 --> 00:48:33,243
I can walk from here.

710
00:48:33,911 --> 00:48:37,664
If you don't mind,
could I have a few minutes alone?

711
00:48:41,793 --> 00:48:42,794
Yeah, okay.

712
00:48:42,878 --> 00:48:45,505
- Thank you.
- I'll be up there in ten.

713
00:50:22,394 --> 00:50:24,021
Hello, Dr. Ye.

714
00:50:31,361 --> 00:50:32,612
Tatiana.

715
00:50:33,196 --> 00:50:34,865
It's good to see you.

716
00:50:35,866 --> 00:50:37,451
Where's Officer Collins?

717
00:50:39,161 --> 00:50:40,704
Was that his name?

718
00:50:45,375 --> 00:50:47,836
I thought the Lord was done with us.

719
00:50:48,545 --> 00:50:49,588
Not all of us.

720
00:51:04,019 --> 00:51:08,899
I'm sorry you had to come all this way
to do something I was going to do myself.

721
00:51:24,289 --> 00:51:25,415
No.

722
00:51:26,041 --> 00:51:28,335
You can't.

723
00:51:28,418 --> 00:51:31,004
It'll be horrible, that fall.

724
00:51:33,215 --> 00:51:35,425
It might not even happen right away.

725
00:51:46,269 --> 00:51:47,437
Please.

726
00:51:48,313 --> 00:51:50,107
I can give you something better.

727
00:51:52,901 --> 00:51:54,528
Something gentle.

728
00:51:55,946 --> 00:51:57,405
Something beautiful.

729
00:52:04,704 --> 00:52:06,289
Can we sit for a moment?

730
00:52:07,207 --> 00:52:08,333
Yes, please.

731
00:52:17,926 --> 00:52:23,098
When I was your age, this was some of
the most beautiful country in the world.

732
00:52:25,559 --> 00:52:28,270
It'll all be better
when the Lord gets here.

733
00:52:34,526 --> 00:52:35,777
I'm sure it will.

734
00:52:39,865 --> 00:52:42,659
Did the Lord tell you
why they sent you to me?

735
00:52:49,416 --> 00:52:50,417
Do you know?

736
00:52:53,879 --> 00:52:55,589
Perhaps it's just your time.

737
00:52:56,923 --> 00:52:58,717
You fulfilled your purpose.

738
00:53:06,892 --> 00:53:07,893
Well.

739
00:53:09,311 --> 00:53:11,771
I'm pleased the Lord hasn't forgotten me.

740
00:53:13,857 --> 00:53:15,692
Yes. Me too.

741
00:53:22,115 --> 00:53:25,911
I wanted to see
one more sunset from this place.

742
00:53:27,787 --> 00:53:29,497
Can we watch it together?

743
00:53:31,082 --> 00:53:32,709
I'd like that very much.

744
00:53:40,508 --> 00:53:42,302
You've worked so hard

745
00:53:43,803 --> 00:53:45,013
for so long.

746
00:53:49,893 --> 00:53:51,686
You deserve a rest.
