- I don't want a job.

Thank you, Master.

206
00:17:21,348 --> 00:17:23,467
As some of you already know,

207
00:17:23,468 --> 00:17:26,347
I set out for the
North some 12 month ago

208
00:17:26,348 --> 00:17:29,027
on a diplomatic mission
to the King of Lapland.

209
00:17:29,028 --> 00:17:31,187
At least, that's what I
was pretending to be doing.

210
00:17:31,188 --> 00:17:34,206
In actual fact, my real aim
was to go further north still,

211
00:17:34,207 --> 00:17:35,590
right on to the ice,

212
00:17:35,591 --> 00:17:37,418
to try and discover what had happened

213
00:17:37,419 --> 00:17:39,052
to the Grumman expedition.

214
00:17:41,228 --> 00:17:43,148
This is the first of
the discoveries I made.

215
00:17:47,668 --> 00:17:51,428
I took this photogram with
standard silver nitrate emulsion.

216
00:17:53,388 --> 00:17:57,027
However, I took two
photograms that day...

217
00:17:57,028 --> 00:18:01,227
the second one with a
specially prepared emulsion.

218
00:18:01,228 --> 00:18:02,867
Where does that light come from?

219
00:18:02,868 --> 00:18:03,947
It isn't light.

220
00:18:03,948 --> 00:18:05,507
It's Dust.

221
00:18:05,508 --> 00:18:06,709
- What?!
- Dust?!

222
00:18:06,710 --> 00:18:07,787
It can't be!

223
00:18:07,788 --> 00:18:09,310

224

LYRA: Shh, I need to see
what he's showing them.

225
00:18:11,588 --> 00:18:13,988
Gentlemen, it is Dust!

226
00:18:16,108 --> 00:18:18,027
It registers as light on the plate

227
00:18:18,028 --> 00:18:22,427
because particles of Dust react
with this emulsion in the same way

228
00:18:22,428 --> 00:18:23,749
that photons of light react

229
00:18:23,750 --> 00:18:26,147
with the standard
silver nitrate emulsion.

230
00:18:26,148 --> 00:18:28,787
As you can see, the figure of
the man is now perfectly visible.

231
00:18:28,788 --> 00:18:31,027
But I'd like you to turn
your attention to the child.

232
00:18:31,028 --> 00:18:32,627
We can't see the child clearly

233
00:18:32,628 --> 00:18:35,147
because the child does
not attract Dust, which,

234
00:18:35,148 --> 00:18:40,067
given the nature of Dust, is
precisely the point, is it not?

235
00:18:40,068 --> 00:18:43,787
We, as adults, are surrounded by Dust.

236
00:18:43,788 --> 00:18:46,227
In fact, we're almost consumed by it.

237
00:18:46,228 --> 00:18:47,587
But children,

238
00:18:47,588 --> 00:18:49,348
it seems, are not.

239
00:18:50,668 --> 00:18:54,787
Gentleman, I believe this is
proof that Dust is exclusively

240
00:18:54,788 --> 00:18:56,267
attracted to adults.

241
00:18:56,268 --> 00:18:59,307
Just as the Magisterium
has always suspected.

242
00:18:59,308 --> 00:19:01,644
My next discovery, however,

243
00:19:01,645 --> 00:19:03,987
may be considered even more heretical.

244
00:19:03,988 --> 00:19:06,587
Asriel! Be very careful!

245
00:19:06,588 --> 00:19:08,667
That's only where it begins
to get exciting, Master.

246
00:19:08,668 --> 00:19:12,587
In one of his last messages
to the Academy in Berlin,

247
00:19:12,588 --> 00:19:15,467
Grumman made reference to
a certain natural phenomenon

248
00:19:15,468 --> 00:19:17,304
only seen in the lands of the North.

249
00:19:17,305 --> 00:19:19,427
I believe this is what
he was referring to.

250
00:19:19,428 --> 00:19:21,307

at it again using mine.

evidence of these multiple worlds

267
00:20:03,026 --> 00:20:04,711
and he paid for it with his life!

Who would have done this?

275

it, academically free.

00:27:37,335 --> 00:27:38,695
I don't trust anyone.

361
00:27:40,028 --> 00:27:41,508
Go to sleep, Lyra.

362
00:27:44,188 --> 00:27:46,028
Take me North with you.

363
00:27:47,428 --> 00:27:48,588
Goodnight, Lyra.

364
00:27:54,588 --> 00:27:56,987
I have no idea how but he knew.

365
00:27:56,988 --> 00:27:59,227
He spilt the decanter himself.

366
00:27:59,228 --> 00:28:01,707
Forgive me, Master, but I
can't help being relieved.

367
00:28:01,708 --> 00:28:04,667
I was never happy about the idea.

368
00:28:04,668 --> 00:28:06,508
Of murder.

369
00:28:08,868 --> 00:28:11,667
Hardly anyone would be happy
with that idea, Charles.

370
00:28:11,668 --> 00:28:15,107
But the balance of Jordan
College was at stake.

371
00:28:15,108 --> 00:28:18,107
There is a great change coming
that will threaten us all.

372
00:28:18,108 --> 00:28:21,747
And the alethiometer warns of
appalling consequences should

373
00:28:21,748 --> 00:28:23,828
Asriel continue his research.

374
00:28:24,868 --> 00:28:27,747
Apart from anything else,
the child will be drawn in...

375
00:28:27,748 --> 00:28:28,907
This is about Lyra?

376
00:28:28,908 --> 00:28:30,107
Yes.

377
00:28:30,108 --> 00:28:33,628
She has a part to play in
all this, and a major one.

378
00:28:37,188 --> 00:28:38,632
The irony is she has to do it all

379
00:28:38,633 --> 00:28:40,427
without realising what she's doing.

380
00:28:40,428 --> 00:28:41,987
But she's just an innocent girl!

381
00:28:41,988 --> 00:28:43,588
And she needs to stay one...

382
00:28:44,868 --> 00:28:46,451
... which has meant protecting her,

383
00:28:46,452 --> 00:28:48,907
making sure the college
was unimpeachable.

384
00:28:48,908 --> 00:28:51,347
But there's little chance
that Asriel's heresy

385
00:28:51,348 --> 00:28:53,307
will not get back to the Magisterium.

386
00:28:53,308 --> 00:28:56,467
You're saying, we have to let her go?

387
00:28:56,468 --> 00:29:00,108
The alethiometer says that
Lyra has to make a journey.

388
00:29:01,588 --> 00:29:03,227
What kind of journey?

389
00:29:03,228 --> 00:29:07,107
One which, I'm afraid,
includes a great betrayal.

390
00:29:07,108 --> 00:29:09,348
Well, who's going to betray her? Asriel?

391
00:29:10,654 --> 00:29:14,334
That's the saddest thing...
she will be the betrayer.

392
00:29:15,788 --> 00:29:18,548
And the experience will be terrible.

393
00:29:19,788 --> 00:29:21,187
We can keep her here.

394
00:29:21,188 --> 00:29:22,827
We must!

395
00:29:22,828 --> 00:29:25,907
I know you care for her,
and you've truly taught her

396
00:29:25,908 --> 00:29:28,434
as well as you could, Charles, but

397
00:29:28,435 --> 00:29:30,492
all we can be is scared for her.

398
00:29:32,268 --> 00:29:34,588
And scared of her.

399
00:29:41,348 --> 00:29:42,868
Come on, hurry up.

400
00:29:58,188 --> 00:30:00,507
Great, you're here! I'm starving.

401
00:30:00,508 --> 00:30:02,067
I brought you an extra sausage.

402
00:30:02,068 --> 00:30:04,427
You mean you got an extra for yourself.

403
00:30:04,428 --> 00:30:06,227
This may be true.

404
00:30:06,228 --> 00:30:07,708
[LYRA LAUGHS]

405
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:14,023
I missed dinner last night.

406
00:30:14,024 --> 00:30:16,327
I noticed. Where were you?

407
00:30:16,328 --> 00:30:17,517
In a cupboard.

408
00:30:17,518 --> 00:30:19,547
The whole night?

409
00:30:19,548 --> 00:30:20,947
Most of it.

410
00:30:20,948 --> 00:30:22,667
It's...

411
00:30:22,668 --> 00:30:24,188
... complicated.

412
00:30:25,348 --> 00:30:27,067
Have you ever heard about Dust?

413
00:30:27,068 --> 00:30:28,907
Dust?

414
00:30:28,908 --> 00:30:31,027
I'm guessing you don't mean
the stuff we polish off?

415
00:30:31,028 --> 00:30:32,388
Unh-unh.

416
00:30:33,508 --> 00:30:35,067
Where should I start?

417
00:30:35,068 --> 00:30:36,547
Are you all right, Lyra?

418
00:30:36,548 --> 00:30:38,027
Just thinking aloud.

419
00:30:38,028 --> 00:30:40,747
Well, there's two
things you need to know.

420
00:30:40,748 --> 00:30:42,067
A Gyptian boy,

421
00:30:42,068 --> 00:30:44,308
Billy Costa, is missing.

422
00:30:45,548 --> 00:30:47,067
Billy Costa?

423
00:30:47,068 --> 00:30:48,987
I remember him... Tony's brother?

424
00:30:48,988 --> 00:30:52,027
Some people are saying
there's a man with bright eyes,

425
00:30:52,028 --> 00:30:55,587
others say it's a singing
man with a fox daemon.

426
00:30:55,588 --> 00:30:57,468
It's got to be the Gobblers.

427
00:30:59,228 --> 00:31:00,627
The Gobblers?

428
00:31:00,628 --> 00:31:04,347
I've told you, the Gobblers are
a myth, Roger, they don't exist!

429
00:31:04,348 --> 00:31:06,508
The Gyptians will find Billy.

430
00:31:07,508 --> 00:31:08,867
Fine.

431
00:31:08,868 --> 00:31:11,588
But don't blame me when I
get to say I told you so.

432
00:31:12,908 --> 00:31:17,467
Second thing... your uncle's
packing up an airship to leave.

433
00:31:17,468 --> 00:31:19,907
Not without me he isn't!

434
00:31:19,908 --> 00:31:21,588
Lyra!

435
00:31:28,068 --> 00:31:29,588
Uncle!

436
00:31:32,788 --> 00:31:33,827
Uncle!

437
00:31:33,828 --> 00:31:36,948
What?! What are you
doing here? I'm busy!

438
00:31:37,988 --> 00:31:39,427
You're not leaving!

439
00:31:39,428 --> 00:31:40,547
I can't stay!

440
00:31:40,548 --> 00:31:42,291
The Magisterium will be on to me by now.

441
00:31:42,292 --> 00:31:43,732
Besides, I got what I came for.

442
00:31:45,508 --> 00:31:47,147
Be a good girl, try and learn something,

443
00:31:47,148 --> 00:31:48,507
and I'll see you on the way back.

444
00:31:48,508 --> 00:31:52,507
Please, Uncle, you've only just
arrived, we've hardly talked!

445
00:31:52,508 --> 00:31:54,227
We need to go.

446
00:31:54,228 --> 00:31:56,107
Please, Uncle!

447
00:31:56,108 --> 00:31:57,267
Lines up!

448
00:31:57,268 --> 00:32:02,187
I am sorry, but I just don't
have time for you right now.

449
00:32:02,188 --> 00:32:03,588
I...

450
00:32:05,148 --> 00:32:06,467
Let's go.

451
00:32:06,468 --> 00:32:09,467
Take me North! You promised you would!

452
00:32:09,468 --> 00:32:13,027
Take me with you, we'd
have lots of time then!

453
00:32:13,028 --> 00:32:15,508
The North is no place for a child.

454
00:32:18,388 --> 00:32:20,347
Did it look like this?

455
00:32:20,348 --> 00:32:21,947
What?

456
00:32:21,948 --> 00:32:24,388
The airship that my parents died in?

457
00:32:26,828 --> 00:32:28,188
No.

458
00:32:29,428 --> 00:32:30,748
No, it was smaller.

459
00:32:40,948 --> 00:32:42,947
She's better than you think she is.

460
00:32:42,948 --> 00:32:45,228
She's special.

461
00:32:46,268 --> 00:32:48,628
Everyone's special!

462
00:33:34,988 --> 00:33:36,668
So, where?

463
00:33:37,589 --> 00:33:40,747
We've searched here and here. Nothing.

464
00:33:40,748 --> 00:33:43,348
We covered all the abandoned
wood. There was nothing...

465
00:33:57,228 --> 00:33:58,627
Lord Faa.

466
00:33:58,628 --> 00:34:00,107
Where is Ma Costa?

467
00:34:00,108 --> 00:34:02,827
We told her to wait on her boat
in case Billy returns there.

468
00:34:02,828 --> 00:34:04,468
And the rest of our people?

469
00:34:05,708 --> 00:34:09,307
- State Police have shown no interest.
- Hmph. No surprises there.

470
00:34:09,308 --> 00:34:11,147
So we're organising teams of our own.

471
00:34:11,148 --> 00:34:13,019
We've got a group that went North

472
00:34:13,020 --> 00:34:14,800
from Magdalen Bridge up the Cherwell.

473
00:34:14,801 --> 00:34:18,507
Nothing. We divided Jericho, we
staked out the Airship Station.

474
00:34:18,508 --> 00:34:23,267
John, the Gobblers will have
got him out of Oxford by now.

475
00:34:23,268 --> 00:34:24,548
You think it's the Gobblers?

476
00:34:25,748 --> 00:34:27,260
The Gobblers haven't took my brother.

477
00:34:27,261 --> 00:34:29,547
That's just a children's story.

478
00:34:29,548 --> 00:34:31,107
No.

479
00:34:31,108 --> 00:34:33,108
The Gobblers are real.

480
00:34:34,268 --> 00:34:38,227
John Faa and I have visited six
different Gyptian communities,

481
00:34:38,228 --> 00:34:41,388
all having children
taken, all the same way.

482
00:34:42,788 --> 00:34:45,107
Yeah, but why? What
can they want with them?

483
00:34:45,108 --> 00:34:46,766
That we don't know.

484
00:34:46,767 --> 00:34:50,347
We don't know what they
do, but we will find out.

485
00:34:50,348 --> 00:34:53,707
We have word they are taking
the children to London.

486
00:34:53,708 --> 00:34:56,107
Maybe it's the best way to hide them?

487
00:34:56,108 --> 00:34:57,867
But we must go and try!

488
00:34:57,868 --> 00:35:00,427
Wait, leave here?

489
00:35:00,428 --> 00:35:02,907
No, no, Ma would never agree to that!

490
00:35:02,908 --> 00:35:05,427
Billy's lost, he's not been taken.

491
00:35:05,428 --> 00:35:07,107
Continue the search.

492
00:35:07,108 --> 00:35:09,827
Cover as much of this
area as we can today.

493
00:35:09,828 --> 00:35:11,707
And if we do not find him here,

494
00:35:11,708 --> 00:35:14,068
we'll go to London and find him there.

495
00:35:21,428 --> 00:35:23,028
Where are you, Billy?

496
00:35:24,708 --> 00:35:28,227
Well, if he won't take us, I'll
find another way to go North.

497
00:35:28,228 --> 00:35:30,707
You are aware that I work here right?

498
00:35:30,708 --> 00:35:34,787
And you're pretty much stuck
here because we're orphans

499
00:35:34,788 --> 00:35:37,228
and both of us have no money.

500
00:35:38,508 --> 00:35:40,707
Sometimes you've got to have dreams.

501
00:35:40,708 --> 00:35:42,507
We're going North, Roger.

502
00:35:42,508 --> 00:35:44,267
I just know we are.

503
00:35:44,268 --> 00:35:45,788
If you say so.

504
00:36:12,588 --> 00:36:14,707
He worked them up into a fervour,

505
00:36:14,708 --> 00:36:17,027
they were almost riotous
by the time he finished.

506
00:36:17,028 --> 00:36:18,907
We're sure this information is correct?

507
00:36:18,908 --> 00:36:21,027
I had good people inside the room.

508
00:36:21,028 --> 00:36:24,467
So Asriel claims he can see Dust now?

509
00:36:24,468 --> 00:36:27,668
It's not what he can see, it's
what he claims to see through it.

510
00:36:30,908 --> 00:36:32,188
A hidden city.

511
00:36:34,308 --> 00:36:35,827
Other worlds.

512
00:36:35,828 --> 00:36:39,548
The Master of Jordan College
risks him saying as much?

513
00:36:40,788 --> 00:36:42,787
Scholastic Sanctuary.

514
00:36:42,788 --> 00:36:45,387
The Master cannot be so
naive as to imagine that

515
00:36:45,388 --> 00:36:48,907
Scholastic Sanctuary protects
him from the accusation of heresy.

516
00:36:48,908 --> 00:36:50,667
Asriel clearly got the better of him.

517
00:36:50,668 --> 00:36:54,667
They've given him an enormous
amount of money... to travel North

518
00:36:54,668 --> 00:36:56,948
and continue with his work.

519
00:37:09,268 --> 00:37:12,147
Discover all you can and
by all means permitted.

520
00:37:12,148 --> 00:37:15,987
This kind of heresy is of the
highest priority to the Magisterium.

521
00:37:15,988 --> 00:37:17,507
I shall take it to the Cardinal.

522
00:37:17,508 --> 00:37:18,827
Yes, Father.

523
00:37:18,828 --> 00:37:21,307
I need to know where he's
going and what exactly...

524
00:37:21,308 --> 00:37:23,867
... he intends to achieve.

525
00:37:23,868 --> 00:37:26,388
I will do all that I can.

526
00:37:27,948 --> 00:37:29,667
Oh, Boreal.

527
00:37:29,668 --> 00:37:32,107
Yes, Father?

528
00:37:32,108 --> 00:37:34,908
Not a word to any of our mutual friends.

529
00:37:37,348 --> 00:37:38,908
That includes her.

530
00:38:00,628 --> 00:38:03,587
ALL: Benedic, Domine.

531
00:38:03,588 --> 00:38:05,587
Nos et dona tua.

532
00:38:05,588 --> 00:38:07,667
Quae de largitate.

533
00:38:07,668 --> 00:38:09,947
Tua sumus sumpturi.

534
00:38:09,948 --> 00:38:14,587
Et concede, ut illis salubriter.

535
00:38:14,588 --> 00:38:20,907
Nutriti tibi obsequium
praestare valeamus.

536
00:38:20,908 --> 00:38:24,388
ALL: Per Christum Dominum nostrum.

537
00:38:26,668 --> 00:38:28,067
Amen.

00:38:28,068 --> 00:38:30,708
ALL: Amen.

539
00:38:38,508 --> 00:38:41,507
- Good evening, Mrs. Coulter.
- Good evening, Master.

540
00:38:41,508 --> 00:38:45,188
Lyra, this is Mrs. Coulter, she
may be of some interest to you.

541
00:38:48,388 --> 00:38:51,707
Oh. Hello. I am not used to
the grandeur of this at all.

542
00:38:51,708 --> 00:38:55,387
You'll have to tell me
which knife and fork to use.

543
00:38:55,388 --> 00:38:58,508
- Oh.
- I don't want to make a fool of myself.

544
00:39:01,828 --> 00:39:03,867
Are you a female scholar?

545
00:39:03,868 --> 00:39:05,507
You seem surprised.

546
00:39:05,508 --> 00:39:08,628
Well, female scholars
don't dress like you.

547
00:39:10,708 --> 00:39:12,588
I'll take that as a compliment.

548
00:39:14,588 --> 00:39:16,585
No, I'm not really a scholar,

549
00:39:16,586 --> 00:39:18,587
I'm a member of St. Sophia's College.

550
00:39:18,588 --> 00:39:20,787
Most of my work takes
place outside Oxford.

551
00:39:20,788 --> 00:39:21,868
Hi, Lyra.

552
00:39:23,268 --> 00:39:25,227
But I'm not interesting.

553
00:39:25,228 --> 00:39:26,667
You are.

554
00:39:26,668 --> 00:39:29,027
Tell me about yourself, Lyra.

555
00:39:29,028 --> 00:39:31,707
Oh, well, nothing to say, really!

556
00:39:31,708 --> 00:39:33,987
So, reports you use the
rooftops as your private

557
00:39:33,988 --> 00:39:36,468
thoroughfare are
completely false, are they?

558
00:39:39,308 --> 00:39:41,187
How do you know about that?

559
00:39:41,188 --> 00:39:44,107
You are quite something, aren't you?

560
00:39:44,108 --> 00:39:46,827
I'm surprised Asriel
doesn't talk about you more.

561
00:39:46,828 --> 00:39:48,507
You know my uncle?

562
00:39:48,508 --> 00:39:50,235
Oh, yeah, we occasionally

563
00:39:50,236 --> 00:39:52,107
bump into each other at
the Arctic Institute.

564
00:39:52,108 --> 00:39:53,667
You're an explorer too?!

565
00:39:53,668 --> 00:39:56,388
Oh, that's such a grand word.

566
00:39:57,668 --> 00:39:59,387
But, yes, I suppose I am.

567
00:39:59,388 --> 00:40:03,067
Have you... ? Have you ever seen
an armoured bear? Or Tartars?!

568
00:40:03,068 --> 00:40:05,147
Well, I've negotiated with bears.

569
00:40:05,148 --> 00:40:07,387
It's much more tiresome than it sounds.

570
00:40:07,388 --> 00:40:10,907
I've fought Tartars and that
can actually be quite fun.

571
00:40:10,908 --> 00:40:12,507
But does this really interest you?

572
00:40:12,508 --> 00:40:14,627
I am capable of being
quite boring sometimes.

573
00:40:14,628 --> 00:40:16,547
No, no, no, no. Where
the North is concerned,

574
00:40:16,548 --> 00:40:18,187
you could never bore me.

575
00:40:18,188 --> 00:40:21,907
Well, my favourite
moment is early morning,

576
00:40:21,908 --> 00:40:25,148
when the sky is high and
the land seems endless.

577
00:40:27,348 --> 00:40:31,667
All that's in front of
you is fresh unbroken snow.

578
00:40:31,668 --> 00:40:33,948
You feel utterly alone...

579
00:40:35,348 --> 00:40:39,547
... and you feel utterly magnificent.

580
00:40:39,548 --> 00:40:41,748
I want to feel like that.

581
00:40:45,388 --> 00:40:47,148
Take a seat, Lyra.

582
00:40:51,068 --> 00:40:53,307
Lyra, do you know why I'm here?

583
00:40:53,308 --> 00:40:58,307
The Master has asked if I can find
a place for you and, naturally,

584
00:40:58,308 --> 00:41:00,508
I wanted to meet you first.

585
00:41:01,028 --> 00:41:03,587
And now that I've met you, I like you,

586
00:41:03,588 --> 00:41:08,507
and I want to offer you a
position as my assistant.

587
00:41:08,508 --> 00:41:11,987
Now, you'll need to learn fast
and I won't take any slacking.

588
00:41:11,988 --> 00:41:15,016
But I think with your enthusiasm

589
00:41:15,017 --> 00:41:18,027
and my know-how we could
make quite the team.

590
00:41:18,028 --> 00:41:19,227
We'd go to the North?

591
00:41:19,228 --> 00:41:21,427
Well, we'll go to London first.

592
00:41:21,428 --> 00:41:25,067
And you'd have to be
prepared to leave tomorrow.

593
00:41:25,068 --> 00:41:28,508
I have an airship booked
for the both of us.

594
00:41:30,188 --> 00:41:32,347
My friend Roger... can he come too?

595
00:41:32,348 --> 00:41:36,267
He's not much of an explorer,
but he can cook and clean and...

596
00:41:36,268 --> 00:41:38,027
The boy in the dining hall?

597
00:41:38,028 --> 00:41:40,667
But I have all the household
staff that I need, Lyra...

598
00:41:40,668 --> 00:41:43,507
He won't let you down. I need him.

599
00:41:43,508 --> 00:41:46,947
He's my best friend, my only friend.

600
00:41:46,948 --> 00:41:48,953
Please. He's an orphan like me

601
00:41:48,954 --> 00:41:52,107
and leaving Jordan College would
be the most exciting thing for us.

602
00:41:52,108 --> 00:41:54,548
Fine. He can come.

603
00:42:06,468 --> 00:42:09,147
Lyra, stop and think
before you tell him.

604
00:42:09,148 --> 00:42:10,987
There is a chance he may not want to go.

605
00:42:10,988 --> 00:42:12,467
Jordan College is all he knows.

606
00:42:12,468 --> 00:42:13,747
It's all I know too!

607
00:42:13,748 --> 00:42:16,707

- We'll explain it to him tomorrow.

Even he'll know he
can't miss this chance.

00:42:22,108 --> 00:42:23,348
We can't.

So, why am I here then?

638
00:44:11,988 --> 00:44:15,067
Lyra, I promised once
to do everything I could

00:44:15,068 --> 00:44:17,387
to protect you from anyone
who might do you harm.

640

Protect me?

641
00:44:18,628 --> 00:44:19,748
From what?

642
00:44:21,428 --> 00:44:23,147
And the older you've got,

643
00:44:23,148 --> 00:44:26,907
the more I've felt the
importance of that promise.

644
00:44:26,908 --> 00:44:28,468
Who did you promise?

645
00:44:29,628 --> 00:44:35,348
I think Mrs. Coulter will do her
best by you, but I can't be sure.

646

So I'm going to give you something.

647
00:44:38,868 --> 00:44:43,748
And I need you to promise
that you will keep it private.

648
00:44:48,708 --> 00:44:50,387
This matters, Lyra.

649
00:44:50,388 --> 00:44:51,908

00:45:09,388 --> 00:45:11,067
It's beautiful.

654
00:45:11,068 --> 00:45:14,427

brought it to this college,

want me to have it anyway.

found his way back to us.

But he has not.

705
00:48:33,548 --> 00:48:37,307
He's just... lost his way

706
00:48:37,308 --> 00:48:38,907

Searching for him here,
when we know he is lost,

710
00:48:44,588 --> 00:48:46,067

Come on.

715
00:49:03,228 --> 00:49:05,588
Good, you're early. I like early.

716
00:49:08,508 --> 00:49:11,587
My friend Roger, he's gone missing,
I can't find him anywhere.

717
00:49:11,588 --> 00:49:14,227
This isn't like him.
Something's happened.

718
00:49:14,228 --> 00:49:17,548
What do you mean? You seem
worried, Lyra. Tell me.

719
00:49:19,536 --> 00:49:20,574
I know the Gobblers...

720
00:49:20,575 --> 00:49:22,840
- Shh.
- ... are just children's stories but...

721
00:49:24,068 --> 00:49:25,627
Not here, Lyra.

722
00:49:25,628 --> 00:49:28,667
But one of the Gyptian
children, Billy Costa,

723
00:49:28,668 --> 00:49:30,867
he's gone missing,

724
00:49:30,868 --> 00:49:33,427
they say it's the Gobblers, so...

725
00:49:33,428 --> 00:49:37,547
With every child's nightmare
there's an element of truth, Lyra.

726
00:49:37,548 --> 00:49:41,002
You're saying the
Gobblers could be real?

727
00:49:41,003 --> 00:49:42,244
They could have Roger?

728
00:49:42,245 --> 00:49:43,267
He was right?

729
00:49:43,268 --> 00:49:45,387
It is possible.

730
00:49:45,388 --> 00:49:47,987
- Then we should call the State Police...
- No, no, no, no.

731
00:49:47,988 --> 00:49:49,867
They'll be of no use at all.

732
00:49:49,868 --> 00:49:52,267
The State Police wouldn't
care about a kitchen boy,

733
00:49:52,268 --> 00:49:54,388
he'll be miles away by now.

734
00:49:55,388 --> 00:49:57,228
Lyra, listen to me.

735
00:49:59,748 --> 00:50:01,227
Do you care for this boy?

736
00:50:01,228 --> 00:50:02,707
Yes.

737
00:50:02,708 --> 00:50:04,227
Does he care for you?

738
00:50:04,228 --> 00:50:06,387
- Yes.
- Right.

739
00:50:06,388 --> 00:50:09,068
Then we'll need to take the
matter into our own hands.

740
00:50:10,628 --> 00:50:13,067
The Gobblers will have
taken him to London.

741
00:50:13,068 --> 00:50:15,547
I'll set down tracks
as soon as we arrive.

742
00:50:15,548 --> 00:50:16,787
The Gobblers are in London?

743
00:50:16,788 --> 00:50:18,467
Yeah, of course they're in London.

744
00:50:18,468 --> 00:50:20,108
Oxford's too small.

745
00:50:21,188 --> 00:50:23,148
In London, children can just...

746
00:50:24,468 --> 00:50:25,988
... disappear.

747
00:50:26,988 --> 00:50:28,907
In Oxford, there's nowhere to hide.

748
00:50:28,908 --> 00:50:30,507
In London, there's everywhere.

749
00:50:30,508 --> 00:50:31,947
And you'll help find him?

750
00:50:31,948 --> 00:50:33,667
Lyra, look at me.

751
00:50:33,668 --> 00:50:37,828
I won't just help, I won't
just try, I'll succeed.

752
00:50:40,828 --> 00:50:42,427
Your luggage, Ma'am.

753
00:50:42,428 --> 00:50:45,027
Right, I'm on the eight o'clock airship.

754
00:50:45,028 --> 00:50:46,548
I expect to see you there.

755
00:50:47,908 --> 00:50:50,907
For your sake and for Roger's.

756
00:50:50,908 --> 00:50:54,068
Lyra, the gift the Master gave you.

757
00:50:57,188 --> 00:50:59,387
What did he say this did?

758
00:50:59,388 --> 00:51:00,948
Tell the truth.

759
00:51:03,068 --> 00:51:05,588
Tell me where Roger is.

760
00:51:10,748 --> 00:51:12,427
Come on.

761
00:51:12,428 --> 00:51:14,667
Tell me where I can find Roger.

762
00:51:14,668 --> 00:51:16,307
The airship is about to leave.

763
00:51:16,308 --> 00:51:17,907
If we're going, we have to go now.

764
00:51:17,908 --> 00:51:20,148
Tell me if the Gobblers have Roger.

765
00:51:23,748 --> 00:51:25,068
If the Gobblers have him...

766
00:51:26,508 --> 00:51:27,628
... she's our...

767
00:51:28,948 --> 00:51:30,428
... best chance of getting him back.

768
00:51:32,668 --> 00:51:34,307
Isn't she?

769
00:51:34,308 --> 00:51:35,988
Wait!

770
00:51:55,828 --> 00:51:58,587
Lyra, I am so glad
you decided to join me.

771
00:51:58,588 --> 00:52:00,828
Here, come, take a seat.

772
00:52:02,708 --> 00:52:05,428
I think it's the best
decision for both of us.

773
00:52:07,628 --> 00:52:09,867
So, where do we start looking for Rog?

774
00:52:09,868 --> 00:52:13,491
Lyra, airships aren't
safe spaces to talk, shh.

775
00:52:13,492 --> 00:52:14,720
But we need to start
thinking about where to...

776
00:52:14,721 --> 00:52:16,587
We're together now.

777
00:52:16,588 --> 00:52:19,268
We'll have plenty of time
to discuss whatever you wish.

778
00:52:20,468 --> 00:52:22,748
A bit of quiet now would be best.

779
00:52:45,268 --> 00:52:47,507
The Gyptians.

780
00:52:47,508 --> 00:52:49,028
They're leaving too?

781
00:53:09,588 --> 00:53:11,188
Let me out!

782
00:53:18,908 --> 00:53:20,987
Lyra, this is your new home.

783
00:53:20,988 --> 00:53:22,867
Home for us all.

784
00:53:22,868 --> 00:53:24,587
Roger's too.

785
00:53:24,588 --> 00:53:25,667
When she finds him.

786
00:53:25,668 --> 00:53:27,507
27 Gyptian children

787
00:53:27,508 --> 00:53:28,867
have been taken.

788
00:53:28,868 --> 00:53:30,587
And now is the time for action.

789
00:53:30,588 --> 00:53:32,587
We will get our children back.

790
00:53:32,588 --> 00:53:36,827
Is it true that you're funding
Asriel's investigations?

791
00:53:36,828 --> 00:53:38,707
What do you know about Dust, Lyra?

792
00:53:38,708 --> 00:53:40,267
It doesn't affect children.

793
00:53:40,268 --> 00:53:41,707
And who did you learn this from?

794
00:53:41,708 --> 00:53:44,707
Recent Gyptian raiders
causing trouble again.

795
00:53:44,708 --> 00:53:47,547
We're going to find out what
they're doing to the children.

796
00:53:47,548 --> 00:53:50,748
This kind of heresy is of highest
priority to the Magisterium.

797
00:53:51,908 --> 00:53:54,947
How are you able to be so
far away from your daemon?

798
00:53:54,948 --> 00:53:58,667
How am I supposed to trust you
when no-one tells me the truth?!

799
00:53:58,668 --> 00:54:00,707
Some things you're
better off not knowing.

800
00:54:00,708 --> 00:54:03,827
The children, they are
taken some distance inland.

801
00:54:03,828 --> 00:54:06,588
- We have to fight.
- We have to kill.

802
00:54:07,828 --> 00:54:09,931
The Magisterium are everywhere.

803
00:54:09,932 --> 00:54:12,628
[WHISPERING]: Lyra, don't breathe.

804
00:54:15,588 --> 00:54:19,307
We all want to find the missing
children so will you stay with us?

805
00:54:19,308 --> 00:54:21,147
- I've been busy.
- Where?

806
00:54:21,148 --> 00:54:22,707
Oxford.

807
00:54:22,708 --> 00:54:25,067
What do all of these symbols mean?

808
00:54:25,068 --> 00:54:28,188
It takes years of study.

809
00:54:29,339 --> 00:54:31,747
It's trying to warn me of something.

810
00:54:31,748 --> 00:54:34,467
I suspect it's trying to
warn you of everything.

811
00:54:34,468 --> 00:54:37,428
We go North. Now!

812
00:54:39,108 --> 00:54:42,227
I represent the Western Gyptians
and we would like to hire you.

813
00:54:42,228 --> 00:54:44,267
I know what you're fighting, kid.

814
00:54:44,268 --> 00:54:45,747
You're going to lose.

815
00:54:45,748 --> 00:54:49,828
I would obtain the services
of an armoured bear.

816
00:54:51,508 --> 00:54:53,188
Tell me where she is.

817
00:54:55,268 --> 00:54:57,699
With Iorek on our side,
we stand a chance.

818
00:54:57,700 --> 00:54:59,700
Has anyone seen a bear?

819
00:55:01,188 --> 00:55:03,148
Who is Lyra Belacqua?

820
00:55:06,108 --> 00:55:08,227
What's he trying to do with Dust?

821
00:55:08,228 --> 00:55:11,067
Flood us all with sin?

822
00:55:11,068 --> 00:55:13,987
This is war.

823
00:55:13,988 --> 00:55:18,308
The fate of more than
this world depends on her.

824
00:55:21,410 --> 00:55:23,170
And who are you, exactly?

825
00:55:24,567 --> 00:55:26,727
- It's time.
- I know.
