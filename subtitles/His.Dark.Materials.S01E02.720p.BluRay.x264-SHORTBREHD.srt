1
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:15,350
Ma'am.

2
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:19,632
Lyra, this is your new home.

3
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:26,592
Is this all yours?

4
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:28,040
Goodness, no.

5
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:30,391
Just the one floor.

6
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:35,600
Go on.

7
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:39,150
I can't believe this is our new home, Pan.

8
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:41,192
Look how shiny the floor is!

9
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:53,190
Right, let me show you around.

10
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:56,074
This is the living room.

11
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:57,714
Wow!

12
00:00:57,840 --> 00:00:59,718
The terrace.

13
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:02,878
Now, up here is my bedroom.

14
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,037
And that's my study,

15
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:08,949
which I'd rather
stayed my private space.

16
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:13,313
And then here is the room
I prepared for you.

17
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:16,513
I'll let you get settled.

18
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:24,473
Oh, I'm drowning!

19
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:28,152
I'm drowning.

20
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:30,431
It is a lot more comfortable than Oxford.

21
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:33,120
And it's our new home.

22
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:35,197
Roger's too...

23
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:36,754
...when she finds him.

24
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:39,479
A home for us all.

25
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:56,073
Billy?

26
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:57,395
Roger!

27
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:59,432
Billy Costa!

28
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:37,751
How are you with heights?

29
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:39,473
They don't scare me.

30
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:42,432
Never have.

31
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:45,029
I used to live on the roof
ofJordan College.

32
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:47,914
I slept out there every other Sunday.

33
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:49,190
No, you didn't.

34
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:50,549
I did!

35
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:57,474
Roger was there too.

36
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:59,796
On the roof.

37
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:01,957
I've got my best people looking for him.

38
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:05,596
We'll find him, Lyra. Soon.

39
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:12,519
I've never been sure about them.

40
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:14,154
Heights.

41
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:19,589
I could never get away
from the occasional urge to jump.

42
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:28,916
Right, let's get to it.

43
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:31,191
Plenty to do before we lunch
at the Arctic Institute.

44
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:33,437
We're lunching at the Arctic Institute?

45
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:35,836
Yes, of course we are. Now, chop chop.

46
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:39,636
Plans to make, clothes to get,
lots to do. Come on.

47
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:52,152
Wow!

48
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:56,750
Is that the Skraeling

49
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:59,714
who mapped the currents
of the Great Northern Ocean?

50
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:01,433
Hello, Eliza.

51
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:03,233
You know him?

52
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:05,829
Of course. Now come, Lyra.

53
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:12,917
Oxford only had so much, but this...

54
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:16,956
Now, what will you eat?

55
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:18,799
I don't care about food.

56
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:21,000
Well, you might care about food
if you were starving.

57
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:24,875
Is that an armoured bear skull?
I've heard so much about them!

58
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:25,920
Lyra.

59
00:05:25,921 --> 00:05:27,037
- It's huge.
- Lyra!

60
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:30,238
Sit down.

61
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:34,480
- Sweetbreads.
- Oh!

62
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:37,399
- Courtesy of the chef, Mrs Coulter.
- Thank him.

63
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:43,596
Mrs Coulter,
I've been thinking about Roger,

64
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:46,030
and I think I should help you
with the search.

65
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:47,753
Like you said in Jordan -

66
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:51,078
child's eyes... useful.

67
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:53,920
Lyra, look around this room.

68
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:56,157
How many women do you see?

69
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:00,239
In every room, there are those
that would belittle you.

70
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:03,592
With my help,
they won't lay a scratch on you.

71
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:06,713
For you will have knowledge
that they won't.

72
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:10,151
I can teach you to wield power
over all of them,

73
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:13,478
but you must let me mould you.

74
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:15,956
You must trust me.

75
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:18,356
I trust you.

76
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:20,790
Then will you let me find Roger for you?

77
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:24,357
- He's my best friend.
- Lyra, I won't let you down.

78
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:30,598
- All right.
- Good.

79
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:34,873
Now, who do you want to be
introduced to first?

80
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,596
A van has been seen leaving
and entering here.

81
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:41,030
We've not confirmed children on board.

82
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:43,516
We've not confirmed?
We need to be confirmed.

83
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:46,838
The Gobblers are efficient,
well protected and well funded.

84
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:48,952
They're so good,
people think they're a myth.

85
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:51,276
So you're saying we know enough?

86
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:53,080
I'd state good odds that the van
is Gobbler

87
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:54,913
and it's being used to transport them.

88
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:57,555
We've been searching for days.
This is the best lead we've got.

89
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:01,515
So tomorrow we attack. In the morning,
we gather our best men.

90
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:03,074
Go in fast through the front door.

91
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:05,590
Take on whatever lies on the other side.

92
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:08,360
Prepare the men. We strike with force.

93
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:19,278
Have you ever considered doing
something different with your hair?

94
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:21,357
I like my hair.

95
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:24,598
No, I don't think
it accentuates your face.

96
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:28,839
Maybe I should grow it.

97
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:30,280
I had long hair.

98
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:32,357
That was really useful.

99
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:36,076
Like, this one time when Roger and I
were caught in this grain silo,

100
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:38,396
we turned my hair into a rope,

101
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:41,957
he climbed up me and out,
and then pulled me out.

102
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:43,400
Lyra, please don't lie to me.

103
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:44,920
- I wasn't.
- Yes, you were.

104
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:50,400
Lyra...

105
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:53,711
...I think you can be extraordinary.

106
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:58,160
But being extraordinary takes application.

107
00:07:58,280 --> 00:08:00,749
It means being prepared to change.

108
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:03,838
And that takes guidance.

109
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:05,155
Hmm?

110
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:12,880
We shouldn't change
just so we can fit in here.

111
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,152
She's being very kind to us, Pan.

112
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:25,314
<i>She's nice.</i>

113
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:28,599
<i>She treats me nice.</i>

114
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:32,474
Don't we deserve to have nice things?

115
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:33,875
For once?

116
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,480
Of course we do.

117
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:39,872
No-one's ever said I could be
extraordinary before.

118
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:14,312
Lyra.

119
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:15,999
Lyra.

120
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:17,759
Mmm... What?

121
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:19,314
Lyra, wake up.

122
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:21,079
Listen to that noise.

123
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:22,793
What is it?

124
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:25,560
It's just the pipes, Pan. It's fine.

125
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:27,000
It's something.

126
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:28,520
Listen.

127
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:30,472
It's nothing.

128
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:33,354
I don't think it's the pipes.

129
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:36,718
Hey, stop.

130
00:09:57,960 --> 00:10:01,954
Stop at nothing. We <i>will</i>
rescue these children.

131
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:06,915
Come on!

132
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:11,474
We're in, sir.

133
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:48,039
That's Billy's.

134
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:56,396
This proves
they <i>were</i> here.

135
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:02,477
The Gobblers must have known
we were coming and moved them.

136
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:06,952
What do they want the children for?

137
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:14,155
You see anything?

138
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:15,873
No, nothing.

139
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,400
Just a brick wall.

140
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:22,192
I miss my ma.

141
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:30,632
I don't have a ma to miss.

142
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:34,712
My aunt brought me up for a bit.

143
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:39,232
And then she found a good job for me
in Jordan College.

144
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:42,039
And then I met Lyra.

145
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:44,720
I know she won't leave us here.

146
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:47,560
She'll be looking for us right now.

147
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:50,359
Wherever she is.

148
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:56,074
I will be having a party for a few friends
and fellow explorers

149
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:59,671
and, Lyra, I'll need your help
serving drinks.

150
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:01,154
Stop.

151
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:03,476
That's it. Perfect.

152
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:05,990
There ain't much give in it.

153
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:08,112
I like running around, you know?

154
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:11,438
The clothes you wear
determine the way people see you.

155
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:14,394
Now come, look in the mirror.

156
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:20,914
I like it...

157
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:22,960
...I think.

158
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:24,753
Blue is quite your colour.

159
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:26,075
Did you know that?

160
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:28,271
I didn't know I had a colour at all.

161
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:35,351
It'll allow me to wield power.

162
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:38,917
Looks like it'll allow you
to wield a cake knife.

163
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:45,710
If my uncle could see me like this...

164
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:49,231
Oh, he'd be delighted... I'm sure.

165
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:12,680
I heard your request,
and I'm unable to grant it.

166
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:16,589
I simply ask to examine what remains
of the head Asriel presented to you

167
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:18,871
before it's treated
and placed in your crypt.

168
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,719
Grumman was a scholar of this college.

169
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:25,073
Word is, you've already allowed his head
to be thawed and treated.

170
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:27,476
Vital information might have been lost.

171
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:31,394
Boreal, as you are aware,

172
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:34,831
scholastic sanctuary...

173
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:37,429
As an executive of the Consistorial Court,

174
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:40,234
I must understand where he's been.

175
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:45,032
They say that he crossed
between the worlds.

176
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:46,674
That's heresy.

177
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:49,554
That's an interesting word
for you to use,

178
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:52,400
especially considering
what I've heard of Asriel's visit

179
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:53,840
to this college.

180
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:56,873
Is it true he spoke of Dust,

181
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:01,153
and that you're funding
his investigations?

182
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:05,234
Whatever you're threatening...

183
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:08,114
I threaten nothing.

184
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:13,232
What do you hide?

185
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:16,512
The only rights the Magisterium has here

186
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:18,438
are the rights I grant it.

187
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:20,916
His skull is in our crypt.

188
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:22,759
It will stay there,

189
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:24,872
as is his right

190
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,310
and our responsibility.

191
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:28,760
Of course...

192
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:30,955
...Master.

193
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:43,156
Lyra, you're still not concentrating.

194
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:48,119
Books aren't what I'm best at.

195
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:50,232
And what <i>are</i> you best at?

196
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:56,038
Can't you mould me into someone
who... reads <i>some</i> books,

197
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:58,470
but who travels mostly?

198
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:01,354
Who adventures?

199
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:03,915
Who looks for people when they're lost?

200
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:06,157
Lyra, did you not agree to trust me?

201
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:09,795
Now, where were you?

202
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:11,673
Yes. Electrons.

203
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:14,440
Now, the thing about electrons
is that they are...

204
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:17,837
They are negatively charged particles,
sort of like Dust,

205
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:19,519
but Dust might not be charged.

206
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:23,755
Dust?

207
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:25,997
You know, from-space Dust.

208
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:27,873
That Dust.

209
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,595
You see, I do know some things.

210
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:32,313
What do you know about Dust, Lyra?

211
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:35,319
It comes from space.
It lights people up if you have...

212
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:37,557
...a special camera to see it by.

213
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:39,717
And...

214
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:41,354
Ah, yes.

215
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:43,233
It doesn't affect children.

216
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:46,516
Who did you learn this from?

217
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:53,272
Just a visiting scholar from
New Denmark who came to Jordan.

218
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:56,916
He was talking to the chaplain,
and I was passing by.

219
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:59,714
I couldn't help but listen.

220
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:02,473
Hmm.

221
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:03,670
Is it right?

222
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:05,314
Will you tell me?

223
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:09,036
Well, I'm sure you know
much more about it than I do.

224
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:14,717
Now, let's get back
to these electrons, hmm?

225
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:21,393
Damn it!

226
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:26,834
Ma, I'll clean it.

227
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:28,679
- No, you won't.
- I want to help.

228
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:30,598
Next time they go out.

229
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:32,518
The answer is no, Tony!

230
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:48,316
- Can I help?
- You can find my son!

231
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:51,990
We were so close, though, Maggie.
If you would have seen...

232
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:54,874
We never should have left Oxford.
He's probably still there,

233
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,913
lost, looking for his ma.

234
00:16:58,040 --> 00:16:59,190
He's not in Oxford.

235
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:01,073
He's in London.

236
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:03,032
The Gobblers took him.

237
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:04,480
And we'll find him.

238
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:06,671
And if you're all wrong?

239
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:08,678
We're not wrong.

240
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:32,440
Ma...

241
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:41,793
Tony...

242
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:51,591
We're going to get him back.

243
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:55,714
Please.

244
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,832
Please.

245
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:03,472
Let's take the fight to these Gobblers.
I've got a plan.

246
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:05,432
Do you want to be part of it, Tony?

247
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:30,350
I made it clear I wasn't to be disturbed.

248
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:33,830
I apologise for disturbing you.

249
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:35,394
My needs were too great.

250
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:40,954
Cardinal.

251
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:44,790
The General Oblation Board
is causing trouble again.

252
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:48,834
A recent Gyptian raid
trying to find those damn children.

253
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:52,630
- Did they?
- No. Give them credit.

254
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:56,231
The General Oblation Board's policy
of moving them constantly and quickly

255
00:18:56,360 --> 00:18:57,999
seems to have borne fruit.

256
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:00,834
But they risk so much.

257
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:07,272
The fathers and I are worried that
they might present future concerns for us.

258
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:10,472
Give me the honour of telling them, sir.

259
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:13,877
Ah, that's why I'm here.

260
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,195
Hmm?

261
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:21,191
Now... tell the Oblation Board
to control it or...

262
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:26,909
...or they'll lose everything.

263
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:32,998
Cardinal.

264
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:54,039
Lyra.

265
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:55,879
It's happening again.

266
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,151
That noise.

267
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:16,914
That is definitely not the pipes
making that noise.

268
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:19,759
It's moving.

269
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:11,273
Lyra!

270
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:12,595
Lyra?

271
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:13,995
Lyra.

272
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:17,993
Lyra.

273
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:23,159
I thought I heard you.

274
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:25,590
What are you doing out of bed?

275
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:28,269
It's very late.

276
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:37,269
Mrs Coulter, how are you able
to be so far away from your daemon?

277
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:39,517
- It's too painful.
- I'm not.

278
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:41,120
It's not natural.

279
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:44,959
He was in the study.

280
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:47,311
You were down the hallway.

281
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:49,238
You're mistaken.

282
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,514
He was with me the entire time.

283
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:57,750
Aw... Lyra.

284
00:21:57,880 --> 00:21:59,360
So sleepy.

285
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:02,437
Best get back to bed now.

286
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:08,918
Goodnight.

287
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:11,191
Sleep tight.

288
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:29,916
I could never be
that far away from you, Lyra.

289
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:31,633
<i>What</i> is <i>she?</i>

290
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:34,719
<i>I don't know, Pan,
but we need to find out.</i>

291
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:13,871
So where are you, Stanislaus Grumman?

292
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:25,874
Which one of these looks to be
the most recently freighted?

293
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:48,154
Asriel was lying.

294
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:52,240
It's not him.

295
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:56,599
We need to cross.

296
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:22,471
What do all of these symbols mean, Pan?

297
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:26,475
Lyra?
I have some guests arriving.

298
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:28,796
Can you please stay in your room?

299
00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:43,875
- Mrs Coulter.
- Father MacPhail.

300
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:48,511
What a lovely surprise.

301
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:50,472
May I have a word with you, please?

302
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:51,829
In private.

303
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:53,110
Yes.

304
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:54,833
Of course.

305
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:56,030
This way.

306
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:01,635
Lyra, that man is Magisterium.

307
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:16,111
Would you like some tea?

308
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:23,954
- Thank you, I don't drink tea.
- No, course you don't.

309
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:28,313
May I fetch you some water?

310
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:30,796
I'm not thirsty.

311
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:32,320
Hmm.

312
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:34,159
Please take a seat.

313
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:35,600
Thank you.

314
00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:48,311
Mrs Coulter, we are excited by your work,

315
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:51,160
by the discoveries you promise,

316
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:53,397
- but...
- Oh, such a shame.

317
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:57,912
There always has to be a "but"
attached to a compliment.

318
00:27:58,040 --> 00:28:00,680
The Cardinal has concerns.

319
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:05,431
This break-in combined with all the
rumour-mongering around your work

320
00:28:05,560 --> 00:28:07,517
has brought it to a head.

321
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:10,155
Well, if the Cardinal
has something to say,

322
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:12,840
I'd prefer he did so in person.

323
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:14,917
Well, he sent me...

324
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:17,999
...to warn you that if your activities
draw too much attention,

325
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:20,919
then the Magisterium will not protect you.

326
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:23,350
Should you be outside this door?

327
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:27,872
And who are you... exactly?

328
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,957
- I'm...
- Excuse me.

329
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:33,360
Lyra, run along.

330
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:35,437
The grown-ups are talking.

331
00:28:35,560 --> 00:28:37,233
- I don't...
- Lyra!

332
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:49,112
Lyra, we can't let them find
the alethiometer.

333
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:52,711
The Master said to keep it secret,
particularly from her,

334
00:28:52,840 --> 00:28:54,240
and the Magisterium.

335
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:57,512
I'll see you both out.

336
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:00,712
Hmm.

337
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:05,633
Here it is.

338
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:18,476
- It stays with us from now on.
- Good.

339
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:33,432
We have an opportunity
to understand Dust.

340
00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:35,711
The Cardinal cannot be telling me
to slow down.

341
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:37,593
He should be telling me
to speed ahead.

342
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:41,031
Whispers become weapons
in the wrong hands.

343
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:42,640
Now, I'm sure you will agree

344
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:46,231
the Magisterium is more valuable
than any of us.

345
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:49,432
Any sacrifice that we have to perform

346
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:52,678
to preserve its power... we do.

347
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:54,871
Gladly.

348
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:18,315
- Part of your outfit for tonight?
- What?

349
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:21,153
The shoulder bag.

350
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:24,239
Well, it's perhaps a little old for you.

351
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
I'm sorry if I was short with you
in front of them.

352
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:29,196
- I...
- You lost control.

353
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:33,759
No, I wouldn't say I lost control.

354
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:36,759
- You were angry, I could see it.
- No, I wasn't angry.

355
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:39,513
And you still are.

356
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:52,714
It looks absurd to be carrying
a shoulder bag in your own home.

357
00:30:54,280 --> 00:30:56,715
It's the only thing I really like wearing.

358
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:16,080
Stop!

359
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:33,917
Stop that! You're hurting us!

360
00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:36,874
If you behave in this vulgar
and coarse way,

361
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,957
then we will have a confrontation...

362
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:40,799
...which I will win.

363
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:42,434
This isn't who you are.

364
00:31:42,560 --> 00:31:44,756
Those men just upset you.

365
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:46,872
Whenever any guests arrive in the future,

366
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,799
they are going to find you
perfectly sweet,

367
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:52,992
charming, innocent, delightful,

368
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:55,157
just as children should be.

369
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:57,112
Do you understand?

370
00:31:57,240 --> 00:32:00,870
You can't treat me like this!
My uncle won't let you!

371
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,993
When has that man
ever done anything for you?

372
00:32:04,120 --> 00:32:05,759
He's done everything.

373
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:09,794
He's done nothing! He's a failure
of a man and a failure of a father!

374
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:26,759
A father.

375
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:33,080
He... He...

376
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:37,160
He's my father, isn't he?

377
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:48,191
I never understood why he kept up
the ridiculous pretence.

378
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:52,999
My parents died in an airship accident.

379
00:33:00,760 --> 00:33:03,195
It was all a lie.

380
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:07,434
He's a liar.

381
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:10,919
He's a liar.

382
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:14,030
My mother...

383
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:17,312
Who is she?

384
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:20,233
Could've been anyone.

385
00:33:22,760 --> 00:33:24,672
He was never in one place for long,

386
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:27,190
and he always had a woman on his arm.

387
00:33:27,320 --> 00:33:31,280
It was Asriel that took you
to that college during the Great Flood.

388
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:34,120
He thought they would protect you.

389
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:35,720
Another ridiculous idea.

390
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:39,197
Couldn't protect a painting
if it was drawn on the walls.

391
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:45,869
No.

392
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,275
Lyra.

393
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:48,959
Lyra...

394
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:57,235
Our origins don't define us.

395
00:33:57,360 --> 00:33:58,999
It's what we do with what we have.

396
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:01,032
Please leave me alone.

397
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:29,874
I need help.

398
00:34:31,240 --> 00:34:33,311
Tell me what she is.

399
00:34:34,920 --> 00:34:37,151
Tell me where Roger is.

400
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:41,440
Tell me where my...

401
00:34:44,520 --> 00:34:46,034
...Lord Asriel is.

402
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:52,914
Why didn't he tell me who he really was?

403
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:55,720
Please.

404
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:05,036
Tell me anything.

405
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:06,640
Please. Something.

406
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:04,120
I was expecting you last week.
What kept you?

407
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:08,359
There's been some... things,

408
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:11,154
complications, back home.

409
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:14,114
Scary things?

410
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:15,469
Fun things?

411
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:16,829
Interesting things?

412
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:21,879
Nothing you're going to tell me.

413
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,515
You have better coffee than we do.

414
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:30,437
Where's the snake?

415
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:34,474
We don't always feel the need to have
our daemons on show all the time, Thomas.

416
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:36,751
Two worlds, both alike in so many ways,

417
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:39,759
and you only seem to care about
what this world can do for yours.

418
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:43,317
You might be better to think about what
your world can do for this one.

419
00:36:47,240 --> 00:36:48,833
Now he comes out.

420
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:50,474
She.

421
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:52,796
And I don't pay you to advise me.

422
00:36:55,560 --> 00:36:56,835
Sure.

423
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:58,076
I was just trying to help.

424
00:36:58,200 --> 00:36:59,600
I can wait.

425
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:04,678
I need to find this man.

426
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:10,034
A man with an osprey for a daemon.

427
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:12,231
It's not exactly discreet.

428
00:37:12,360 --> 00:37:15,432
I think someone would have seen him
if he was hanging around here.

429
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:21,116
He's been investigating
multiple worlds for some time.

430
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:23,277
I believe he's here.

431
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:26,712
So he's done what you've done.

432
00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:28,559
He's crossed into our world.

433
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:31,195
Did he use the same window?

434
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:33,198
Do you think there are others?

435
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:39,876
I'll see what I can do.

436
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:49,637
Your friend, Roger,
perhaps you were right.

437
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:52,355
Perhaps he was atJordan College
the whole time.

438
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:54,039
Sorry?

439
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:55,992
All the digging that I'm doing,

440
00:37:56,120 --> 00:37:58,555
and it seems like he just can't be found.

441
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:03,034
I suspect he didn't leave Oxford,
after all.

442
00:38:03,160 --> 00:38:05,470
Someone atJordan would have told me.

443
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:09,355
Something you'll learn, Lyra -

444
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:13,520
if you're not in people's lives,
they can forget you quite quickly.

445
00:38:15,840 --> 00:38:17,399
Jordan has moved on.

446
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:18,920
Roger has moved on.

447
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:20,872
Now you need to move on.

448
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:25,553
You're lying.

449
00:38:27,720 --> 00:38:28,870
Interesting...

450
00:38:30,080 --> 00:38:32,914
...that <i>you</i> would
accuse <i>me</i> of that.

451
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,400
Eat up!

452
00:38:44,360 --> 00:38:48,673
Lyra, I don't think she's been
looking for Roger at all.

453
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:51,156
We have to find out what she's doing.

454
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:54,398
What were those Magisterium officials
doing here?

455
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:10,073
Is she leaving?

456
00:39:23,640 --> 00:39:26,997
It's locked. Without her key,
we can't open it.

457
00:39:27,120 --> 00:39:28,952
So what do I do?

458
00:39:29,080 --> 00:39:30,275
Her study.

459
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:31,720
Let's find out what she's hiding.

460
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:44,032
It's locked.

461
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:47,112
Like everything in this apartment!

462
00:39:47,240 --> 00:39:48,913
And what does that tell you?

463
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:50,599
Doesn't matter what it tells me, Pan.

464
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:53,110
When did a locked door
stop <i>us?</i>

465
00:40:08,120 --> 00:40:09,156
That's weird.

466
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:44,277
He <i>can</i> separate
from her.

467
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:46,631
Now do you see why I don't trust them?

468
00:40:46,760 --> 00:40:48,513
This is how he moves around.

469
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:50,916
He can listen to us the whole time, Pan.

470
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:52,520
So let's use it ourselves.

471
00:41:07,480 --> 00:41:09,119
Children...

472
00:41:09,240 --> 00:41:11,994
...you have a visitor.

473
00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:34,991
How lovely to see you all.

474
00:41:35,120 --> 00:41:37,237
You have quite cheered me up.

475
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:43,190
I have an announcement to make.

476
00:41:43,320 --> 00:41:45,596
We're going to have an adventure together.

477
00:41:46,920 --> 00:41:48,798
We're going to go on a voyage

478
00:41:48,920 --> 00:41:51,719
to the best place
you could possibly go to.

479
00:41:51,840 --> 00:41:53,479
Where?

480
00:41:53,600 --> 00:41:54,829
My ma...

481
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:58,397
...Will be worried, of course she will,
and that's why I'm here -

482
00:41:58,520 --> 00:42:00,432
to write a letter for your mother.

483
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:04,558
"General Oblation Board of London...

484
00:42:04,680 --> 00:42:07,832
"General Oblation Board of London..."

485
00:42:07,960 --> 00:42:09,997
Pan, what's the General Oblation Board?

486
00:42:10,120 --> 00:42:11,952
I don't know.

487
00:42:12,080 --> 00:42:14,197
All my love...

488
00:42:14,320 --> 00:42:16,118
- ...Billy.
- Billy.

489
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:18,232
"General Oblation Board..."

490
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:23,274
Now, I think it's your turn.

491
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:24,800
I ain't got a family.

492
00:42:24,920 --> 00:42:26,070
Oh.

493
00:42:26,200 --> 00:42:29,511
So I'll write to my friend, Lyra,

494
00:42:29,640 --> 00:42:31,632
from Jordan College.

495
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:34,275
How nice to write to a friend!

496
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:40,789
<i>Dear Lyra, you must be wondering
where I am.</i>

497
00:42:40,920 --> 00:42:44,038
We're about to go on a trip,

498
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:46,550
<i>all the way to the North...</i>

499
00:42:46,680 --> 00:42:49,149
What have you found, Lyra?

500
00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:52,393
<i>...to a place called
the Station.</i>

501
00:42:52,520 --> 00:42:53,954
The Station...

502
00:42:54,080 --> 00:42:55,639
<i>You'd be surprised</i>

503
00:42:55,760 --> 00:42:57,831
who's taking us.

504
00:42:59,480 --> 00:43:01,790
The station of what?

505
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:05,709
<i>But I hope you know that I'd never want to
go on an adventure withoutyou.</i>

506
00:43:05,840 --> 00:43:07,752
<i>I miss you.</i>

507
00:43:07,880 --> 00:43:11,078
All my love... Roger.

508
00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:13,355
Roger.

509
00:43:13,480 --> 00:43:16,871
Pan, these letters are about
building something in the North.

510
00:43:50,520 --> 00:43:52,159
Hmm.

511
00:44:01,600 --> 00:44:04,160
Is that a human and his daemon, Pan?

512
00:44:04,280 --> 00:44:06,431
Looks like it...

513
00:44:09,120 --> 00:44:10,634
<i>What is she doing?</i>

514
00:44:11,720 --> 00:44:13,473
I don't... I don't understand.

515
00:44:13,600 --> 00:44:15,671
Lyra, we should go!

516
00:44:19,400 --> 00:44:22,393
Lyra, the lift has been called.
She'll be on her way up soon!

517
00:44:22,520 --> 00:44:25,274
Come on, come on, come on...

518
00:44:25,400 --> 00:44:27,960
Lyra, quickly! Quickly!

519
00:44:29,400 --> 00:44:31,995
Come on, come on.

520
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:38,437
Hurry! We've got to get out of here.
Quickly, Lyra!

521
00:45:20,840 --> 00:45:22,797
- That's lovely to see.
- Oh?

522
00:45:22,920 --> 00:45:25,480
I was just reading about the North.

523
00:45:34,600 --> 00:45:36,159
Well...

524
00:45:36,280 --> 00:45:38,272
...I'll leave you to it.

525
00:45:43,160 --> 00:45:44,355
Hmm.

526
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:46,039
Dinner in an hour.

527
00:46:14,640 --> 00:46:17,314
Did you see the equipment?

528
00:46:17,440 --> 00:46:19,159
A blade.

529
00:46:19,280 --> 00:46:21,272
To cut what?

530
00:46:21,400 --> 00:46:23,073
Where are we, Pan?

531
00:46:23,200 --> 00:46:24,919
And what is she?

532
00:46:25,040 --> 00:46:28,033
What do you think the Master meant
about this and my fath...

533
00:46:28,160 --> 00:46:30,231
...Lord Asriel?

534
00:46:30,360 --> 00:46:34,195
Perhaps we've got to keep it safe
and give it to him?

535
00:46:34,320 --> 00:46:38,997
But wasn't the Master going to poison him?

536
00:46:41,760 --> 00:46:45,231
I don't think I understand
any grown-ups at all.

537
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:51,354
Thank you, Lyra.

538
00:47:57,200 --> 00:47:58,714
Ah!

539
00:48:00,360 --> 00:48:02,511
Hello, darling. You must be Lyra.

540
00:48:02,640 --> 00:48:04,632
We've heard all about you.

541
00:48:26,560 --> 00:48:28,313
Lots of people here, aren't there?

542
00:48:28,440 --> 00:48:31,194
She's so good at keeping everyone happy.

543
00:48:31,320 --> 00:48:33,471
And yet you look so restless.

544
00:48:33,600 --> 00:48:36,240
Like you're desperate to escape.

545
00:48:36,360 --> 00:48:37,840
Shall we sit?

546
00:48:37,960 --> 00:48:40,236
No, I've... I've got to...

547
00:48:40,360 --> 00:48:44,070
Do you know what's happening here?
Come on.

548
00:48:53,680 --> 00:48:56,195
No need to look so pleased with yourself.

549
00:48:56,320 --> 00:48:58,471
You're late.

550
00:48:59,520 --> 00:49:01,079
I've been busy.

551
00:49:01,200 --> 00:49:02,680
Where?

552
00:49:04,840 --> 00:49:06,240
Oxford.

553
00:49:12,040 --> 00:49:13,235
Hmm.

554
00:49:13,360 --> 00:49:16,956
- Tell me what you know.
- I think it's a good strategy, actually.

555
00:49:17,080 --> 00:49:21,393
Best was to stay safe from the Gobblers -
move in with one of them.

556
00:49:21,520 --> 00:49:23,637
That's what they call it, isn't it?

557
00:49:23,760 --> 00:49:28,312
The initials you see -
General Oblation Board.

558
00:49:28,440 --> 00:49:29,840
Gobbler!

559
00:49:32,080 --> 00:49:35,517
She's involved... in the...

560
00:49:35,640 --> 00:49:37,757
She <i>is</i> the Oblation Board.

561
00:49:37,880 --> 00:49:41,078
It's entirely her own project.

562
00:49:41,200 --> 00:49:43,795
You didn't know?

563
00:49:43,920 --> 00:49:45,559
Who's that with Lyra?

564
00:49:45,680 --> 00:49:49,993
- She's a journalist.
- We need to get her out of here.

565
00:49:50,120 --> 00:49:51,839
I've got to go.

566
00:49:51,960 --> 00:49:53,189
Lyra! Lyra!

567
00:49:53,320 --> 00:49:56,711
Papers, letters -
anything could be hugely useful.

568
00:49:56,840 --> 00:49:58,194
Er... No...

569
00:49:58,320 --> 00:49:59,879
Lyra...

570
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:01,559
- Lyra?
- I'm all right.

571
00:50:01,680 --> 00:50:03,016
- I'm just getting some ice.
- Lyra!

572
00:50:03,040 --> 00:50:05,509
You're doing brilliantly.
Just stay calm.

573
00:50:05,640 --> 00:50:08,633
Lyra, look! There's too many people here.

574
00:50:08,760 --> 00:50:10,638
She hasn't locked the lift!

575
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:22,435
We can't leave without it.
We can't leave without it.

576
00:50:24,880 --> 00:50:29,033
Now, what would you, a journalist,
be talking to my assistant about...

577
00:50:30,360 --> 00:50:32,955
...at a party you weren't invited to?

578
00:50:34,440 --> 00:50:36,318
Come this way.

579
00:50:36,440 --> 00:50:37,760
Come on!

580
00:50:41,760 --> 00:50:43,672
I'll handle her.

581
00:50:43,800 --> 00:50:45,712
You concentrate on the girl.

582
00:50:49,920 --> 00:50:51,832
You're coming with me.

583
00:50:51,960 --> 00:50:53,599
Lyra!

584
00:50:53,720 --> 00:50:55,632
Be careful, Lyra!

585
00:50:58,200 --> 00:50:59,873
Lyra?

586
00:51:14,920 --> 00:51:16,240
Lyra!

587
00:51:30,160 --> 00:51:31,514
Please...

588
00:51:37,840 --> 00:51:42,517
Such a delicate face you have
for such indelicate matters.

589
00:51:42,640 --> 00:51:44,632
If you know who Mrs Coulter is...

590
00:51:46,120 --> 00:51:48,191
...then you know who I am.

591
00:51:48,320 --> 00:51:49,674
Correct?

592
00:51:49,800 --> 00:51:51,678
Please don't hurt me.

593
00:51:56,720 --> 00:51:58,393
Beautiful.

594
00:51:58,520 --> 00:52:02,673
Quite, quite beautiful.

595
00:52:13,360 --> 00:52:16,273
Girls to the left. Boys to the right.

596
00:52:16,400 --> 00:52:18,039
Girls to the left.

597
00:52:19,680 --> 00:52:21,080
Boys to the right.

598
00:52:21,200 --> 00:52:23,032
Where are you taking us?

599
00:52:23,160 --> 00:52:25,072
We're going on a trip...

600
00:52:25,200 --> 00:52:27,556
...to the North.

601
00:52:27,680 --> 00:52:32,994
To the best place you could
<i>possibly</i> go to.

602
00:52:35,440 --> 00:52:36,715
Lyra!

603
00:52:36,840 --> 00:52:38,160
Lyra, slow down!

604
00:52:38,280 --> 00:52:39,509
We haven't been followed.

605
00:52:39,640 --> 00:52:41,240
How do you know
we haven't been followed?

606
00:52:41,320 --> 00:52:44,836
We need to get off the streets,
find a place to settle for the night.

607
00:52:44,960 --> 00:52:49,751
- We need to find Roger.
- What use is there looking in the dark?

608
00:52:54,120 --> 00:52:55,679
Are you ready?

609
00:52:57,440 --> 00:52:58,954
Let's go.

610
00:53:07,080 --> 00:53:08,878
We'll try to keep warm.

611
00:53:12,040 --> 00:53:14,430
- And then we'll...
- ...Find Roger.

612
00:53:16,640 --> 00:53:18,359
<i>Find Roger...</i>

613
00:53:31,640 --> 00:53:32,869
He liked her, Pan.

614
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:34,719
I know.

615
00:53:36,800 --> 00:53:37,800
And she's...

616
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:40,000
...she's so...

617
00:53:40,040 --> 00:53:41,040
You're tired.

618
00:53:41,080 --> 00:53:42,878
Try and sleep.

619
00:53:53,800 --> 00:53:57,157
Lyra! Can you hear that?

620
00:54:08,360 --> 00:54:09,794
Pan!

621
00:54:09,920 --> 00:54:11,559
No, no!

622
00:54:11,680 --> 00:54:13,080
Where are you going?
