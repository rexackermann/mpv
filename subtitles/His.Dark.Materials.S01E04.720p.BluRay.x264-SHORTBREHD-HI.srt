00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:55,032
Finally got a lead on Iorek.

19
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:20,271
Looks like we're not the only ones
heading to Trollesund.

20
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:24,110
Lee, are you sure Iorek
will want us making trouble?

21
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:26,835

Then I nearly made a horrible mistake.

26
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:42,320

00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:44,909
My question exactly.

00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:47,191

29
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:49,789
I did hear a rumour that interested me.

00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:52,832
Rumour of a bear.

31
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:54,553
Any truth to that?

32
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:57,479
Yes, I heard a rumour, too,
of an aeronaut

33
00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:00,320
who creates bedlam wherever he goes.

34
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:03,314

- Friendly place.

36

Yeah.

37
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:19,394
No, it's not.

38
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:22,354
Can we just stay out of trouble?

39
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:23,914
Gyptians.

and now that I'm here,

55

I'm not so sure I want to be.

A word, please.

59
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:21,075
I need to know if I can trust in
your readings of the alethiometer.

60
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:22,554
How do you decipher it?

61
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:24,592
I kind of feel them or see them.

62
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:27,474

65
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,311
Well, I put my mind down,
and there's another meaning.

66
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:40,320
I sort of... sense what they mean.

67
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:43,200
It's got a trick in it.

68
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:45,880
- Sort of like focusing your eyes.
- Ah.

69
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,072
So, say you wanted to ask
the alethiometer

70
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:51,669
what your parents are doing now?

71
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:54,031
- Well, the Madonna is Mrs Coulter.
- Oh.

72
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:56,231
The Madonna, is it?

73
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:59,273
And for Asriel,
it would be the globe.

74
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:03,679
So, I think of my parents
when I put the hand there.

75
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:07,999
And then I go for the ant,
because that means busy.

76
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:11,716
But how do you know
what these meanings are? Hmm?

77
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:19,479
The Magisterium. Put it away, Lyra.

78
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:32,277
You understand the man
we're going to see is important?

79
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:34,436
Yes.

80
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:37,678
The Witch Consul is a link between
the human world and the witches.

81
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:40,156
He will decide whether
to pass our message on.

82
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:42,636
And we need the witches.

83
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:45,229
Yes, but he'll want to know everything.

84
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:47,511
The Consul is the only way
to contact the witches,

85
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:50,280
and he must trust us first,
but if he does,

86
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:54,553
a witch called Serafina Pekkala
will surely come to our aid.

87
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:57,400
With her help,
we will find the children.

88
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:59,876
- You mean she'll lead us to Roger?
- Yes.

89
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,400
Just follow my lead.

90
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:03,716

How can I help you, Farder Coram?

93
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:16,279
I met a witch some years ago
in the fen country of eastern Anglia.

94
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:18,471
Her name was Serafina Pekkala.

95
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:20,592
I wish to get a message to her.

96
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:25,117
I'm aware of your relationship
with Serafina Pekkala, Farder Coram.

97
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:30,912
I represent a number of Gyptian families
who have lost children.

98
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:35,512
We believe there is an organisation
that is capturing these children,

99
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:38,394
ours and others,
and taking them north.

100
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:41,194
We need her help to get them free.

101
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:43,280
Well...

102
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:48,476
You realise that relations
between the witches

103
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:51,798
and the authorities

104
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:54,719
are... perfectly cordial.

105
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:58,836
It is my job to keep them that way.

106
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:03,477
You refer... to the Magisterium. Hmm?

107
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:08,840
This fight is not ours.

108
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:12,112
They are stealing children.

109
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:15,278
This is war for all of us.

110
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:20,439
And I know Serafina
will want to be part of it.

111
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:28,350
The children do not remain here for long.

112
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:30,836
They are taken some distance inland.

113
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:32,952
Do you know what happens
to them there?

114
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:36,960
I've heard variously
of the Maystadt Process,

115
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:40,312
or an... intercision.

116
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:44,514
The process is shrouded in secrecy,
but the rumours <i>are</i> disturbing.

117
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:49,510
There's a reason why you don't see a child
on the streets of Trollesund.

118
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:53,958
We, too, have felt the effects
of missing children.

119
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:59,712
Then I will leave you to let Serafina
know what we ask of her.

120
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:02,195
Come.

121
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:10,194
I understand you are in possession
of an alethiometer.

122
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:13,996
I have eyes everywhere
in Trollesund.

123
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:16,595
Yes.

124
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:18,951
May I look at it?

125
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:30,199
It's exquisite.

126
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:33,519
Do you possess the books of readings?

127
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:37,474
Actually...

128
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:40,590
...I can read it.

129
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:44,240
You are very wise to say so.

130
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:48,676
How?

131
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:50,792
I just can.

132
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:53,349
Well...

133
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:56,552
I wonder if I might ask to see you do so.

134
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,229
Down here,

135
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:01,556
there are many sprigs of cloud-pine.

136
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:04,791
Which one belongs to
Serafina Pekkala?

137
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,959
I can summon the witches
through cloud-pine.

138
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:18,435
Each spray of cloud-pine
is specific to a witch.

...and the moon.

This one's hers.

144
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:14,474
I'd like to give you something
to take away with you.

145
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:17,752
Carry this spray with you,

146
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:20,076
and if you ever truly need her...

147
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:24,720
...she will come.

148
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:30,399
Dr Lanselius,
may I ask you something?

149
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:31,556
Of course.

150
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:35,356
What question should we be asking you
that we are not?

151
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:41,994
You're weak.

152
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:46,797
You may have heart,
but the Magisterium have muscle.

153
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:53,280
I would ask where I could obtain the
services of an armoured bear.

154
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:58,076
I understood the armoured bears
answered to nobody.

155
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:00,874
There is at least one who does.
An exile.

156
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:04,077
He shamed his people,
but be warned -

157
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:06,874
his skill with metal
makes him useful to the town.

158
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,391
They don't like strangers knowing about
him or interfering in his affairs.

159
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:13,479
You'll find him beside Einarsson's Bar.

160
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:17,799
But to get him away will take some doing.

161
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:19,673
His name...

162
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:22,269
...is Iorek Byrnison.

00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:28,073

there will surely be a battle.

What do you do... in the metalworks?

175
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:17,474
I mend the broken machinery.

176
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:19,717
I lift heavy objects.

177

00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:40,675
- The town's no place for Iorek.
- How do you know him?

359
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:42,632
Well, she's just a sprung box, isn't she?

360
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:44,040
She just keeps asking questions.

361
00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:47,318
Lee Scoresby.
Can you tell me where to find him?

362
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:49,557
I'm just following her lead.

363
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:53,233
What is it about him?

364
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:54,510
What's keeping him trapped?

365
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:57,155
Kid, I'll tell you that when you tell me
what you know.

366
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:00,634
Another time.

367
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:02,035
Why won't you tell me?

368
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:03,753
Because we need him,

369
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:05,837
and I'm not sure that
you won't take him from us.

370
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:14,911
FARDER: Serafina once told me
of a prophecy about a child.

371
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:16,872
I think it could be Lyra.

372
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,071
People see something in her.

373
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:21,760
You should have seen Dr Lanselius.

374
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:24,395
The look on his face when
she answered his questions.

375
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:26,318
- He looked...
- How?

376
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:27,440
Greedy.

377
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:29,074
Greedy?

378
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:32,830
There are things going on, John,
that we do not understand.

379
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:35,395
The further north we go,
the more we must watch her.

380
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:36,840
(SHRILL SCREECHING)

381
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:38,553
Ah.

382
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:41,320
- A spy.
- No.

383
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:45,473
The Witch Consul must have
passed on our message.

384
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:47,637
Serafina's daemon.

385
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:50,234
So it's true.

386
00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:53,398
The witches do have the power
to send their daemons from them.

387
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:14,680
I have... changed much

388
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:17,076
since last you saw me, Kaisa.

389
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:20,193
You have, Coram van Texel.

390
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:27,390
May I introduce John Faa,

391
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:29,512
king of the western Gyptians?

392
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:33,634
This is Kaisa,
daemon of Serafina Pekkala,

393
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:35,797
queen of the Lake Enara clan.

394
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:38,719
Serafina sends you happiness...

395
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:40,115
How far away is she?

396
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:43,916
...and she asks if you have come
to make war.

397
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:48,312
If it takes war...

398
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:50,511
...to get our children back,

399
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:52,916
then we are ready to wage it.

400
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:57,751
- I'd hope the witches would help.
- Not all will.

401
00:26:57,880 --> 00:27:00,395
Some clans are working with
the Oblation Board.

402
00:27:00,520 --> 00:27:03,194
Those who search for Dust.

403
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:08,111
And where are they now,
these Dust-hunters?

404
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:10,391
Four days northeast of here.
They call it the Station.

405
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:13,274
The witches call it Bolvangar.

406
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:14,470
Bolvangar?

407
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:18,594
Translated, that means...

408
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:21,314
...fields of evil.

409
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:23,909
Can you take us there?

410
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:29,513
Serafina Pekkala will support you
in whatever route your path takes.

411
00:27:54,760 --> 00:27:56,911
LYRA: What do you think it is, Pan,

412
00:27:57,040 --> 00:27:59,874
makes it look like that?

413
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,992
I don't know,

414
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:04,840
but it's... It's amazing.

415
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,720
Do you think that's what
Dust looks like?

416
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:17,552
There's something in it.

417
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:21,437
Not quite...

418
00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:24,155
It looks like a city.

419
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:30,029
It's gone.

420
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:39,156
Maybe it's the alethiometer,

421
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:41,192
telling us where to go,

422
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:43,232
where Roger is.

423
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:45,033
Maybe.

424
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:49,392
Do you think he's cold?

425
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:52,552
I hope not.

426
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:54,478
I'm the same.

427
00:28:56,680 --> 00:29:01,118
I find myself thinking about Billy
at the strangest times.

428
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:06,350
Even found myself thinking about him
on the toilet this morning.

429
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:11,152
Heard you met a bear.

430
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:12,873
Yeah.

431
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,116
Fun?

432
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:17,399
Scary?

433
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:20,793
Confusing.

434
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:25,030
Definitely not what I expected.

435
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:32,871
We're going to get them back, Tony.

436
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:36,555
I know.

437
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:43,274
We will do whatever it takes
to get them back.

438
00:29:58,160 --> 00:30:00,994
HESTER: Hey, Lee, can we take a break?

439
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:04,477
We've been searching for hours.
I don't think he's here...

440
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:07,916
Iorek Byrnison!

441
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:12,755
Uh...

442
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:14,758
It's been some time.

443
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:16,519
What are you doing here?

444
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:19,109
IOREK: It hasn't been some time.

445
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:23,200
It's been three years. (GROWLS)

446
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:25,039
Three years, long as all that?

447
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:30,030
It has not been a good three years.
(GROWLS)

448
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:33,157
We want to help, Iorek.
Can we help?

449
00:30:34,520 --> 00:30:37,558
I owe you. We both know it.

450
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:42,836
And how can you help me?

451
00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:46,919
Some look good naked. You do not.

452
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:49,600
Who has it?

453
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:51,359
Your armour?

454
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:56,430
I am drunk, Lee,
and not behaving as a bear should,

455
00:30:56,560 --> 00:30:58,233
and I'd rather you leave me.

456
00:30:58,360 --> 00:31:00,272
And what if I don't want to go?

457
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:04,350
You know, when I see an old friend,

458
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:06,836
I'm inclined to tell him where I've been,

459
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:09,111
adventures I've had.

460
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:11,072
I have done things...

461
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:14,072
...I can't talk about.

462
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:17,398
I've done some things I'm not too keen
on people knowing either.

463
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:21,757
Tell me what you've done.

464
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:25,237
We wouldn't judge you,
couldn't judge you.

465
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:29,240
And what if I desire to be judged?

466
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:32,113
Don't let him go.

467
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:34,709
We came here just for you, Iorek!

468
00:31:34,840 --> 00:31:37,150
Then you should leave, Lee,

469
00:31:37,280 --> 00:31:40,318
for I neither asked you to come,

470
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:42,716
nor do I want you to stay.

471
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:12,080
It's not often we get
customers waiting for us.

472
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:14,237
You haven't got that lucky,
Mr Sysselman.

473
00:32:14,360 --> 00:32:15,953
I'm not handing myself in.

474
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:17,673
Oh, is that right?

475
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:20,359
(BOTH LAUGH)

476
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:24,320
How can I help?

477
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:26,352
I'm representing the bear.

478
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:28,153
The bear's case is closed.

479
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:30,840
Correction, I am representing
myself via the bear.

480
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:33,634
The trouble is, you confiscated
my property instead of his.

481
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:35,831
Yes, I doubt that, Mr Scoresby.

482
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:37,096
This is why I've been seeking him.

483
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:40,636
Now, this is a bill of sale stating that

484
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:43,400
I, not Iorek Byrnison,
own his armour.

485
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:45,796
He lost it to me in a game of cards,
you see.

486
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:47,877
I've come back to reclaim it.

487
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:56,991
The bear's armour belongs
to the Magisterium.

488
00:32:58,760 --> 00:32:59,989
Ah, yes.

489
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:03,796
He is paying off a blood debt.

490
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:08,119
Ha. Well, yes,
this document is correct

491
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:10,197
as far as the <i>Crime And Debt Act,</i>

492
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:14,314
chapter 3, paragraph 4.5
is concerned. The trouble is,

493
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:15,880
the <i>Crime And Debt Act</i> is superseded

494
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,435
in this circumstance by
the <i>Possession Of Goods Act,</i>

495
00:33:18,560 --> 00:33:21,632
part 3, subsection 4,
Miscellaneous Provisions,

496
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:24,878
which clearly states, and I quote,
"The possession of valuables

497
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,798
- "belongs to..."
- Please!

498
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:29,879
Do not doubt my intelligence, Mr Scoresby.

499
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,957
It's not your intelligence I doubt,
Mr Sysselman.

500
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:33,958
Who paid you to write this

501
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:36,515
and how much will it cost me
for you to rewrite it?

502
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:39,872
Now, you be careful what
you accuse me of.

503
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:43,080
Not even money'll work.

504
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:46,079
They've got you well controlled,
haven't they?

505
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:49,513
Whatever you're accusing me of...

506
00:33:49,640 --> 00:33:52,075
Now, the North, as I understand it,

507
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:55,193
has always been a place for people
who didn't fit in or didn't want to.

508
00:33:55,320 --> 00:33:57,391
The Magisterium has been
trying to gain power

509
00:33:57,520 --> 00:33:58,920
out here for a generation.

510
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:03,319
No-one ever actually let them in
until, perhaps, now.

511
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:09,834
Be very careful.

512
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:12,434
He's a bear.

513
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:14,631
He can't be a slave.

514
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:16,672
Not to you,

515
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:20,396
the Magisterium or anyone.

516
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:23,153
Shame on you, Mr Sysselman.

517
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:47,832
MRS COULTER: I believe I have been helpful

518
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:51,032
in the disposal of Iorek Byrnison

519
00:34:51,160 --> 00:34:53,550
and helping you take your rightful throne.

520
00:34:57,840 --> 00:34:59,718
I'm perfectly prepared.

521
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:07,631
My Northern king...

522
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:16,393
We're leaving?

523
00:35:16,520 --> 00:35:18,193
Yes. The witches have agreed to help us.

524
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:21,870
But... but we haven't got Iorek.
The Witch Consul said we need Iorek.

525
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:26,119
He also warned there was little chance
of getting him away.

526
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:28,960
You don't know what awaits us out there.

527
00:35:29,080 --> 00:35:31,356
With Iorek on our side,
we stand a chance.

528
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:33,358
Lyra, we've just had a good word

529
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:35,995
that your father
has been taken prisoner

530
00:35:36,120 --> 00:35:37,918
and is guarded by armoured bears.

531
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:40,430
The Magisterium are everywhere.

532
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:41,880
We can't dare wait.

533
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,593

- (ROARS)

713
00:47:43,800 --> 00:47:45,393
Let go of him!

714
00:47:45,520 --> 00:47:48,638
I told you - if they fight...

715
00:47:50,040 --> 00:47:51,599
- ...they die!
- You owe me a debt.

716
00:47:51,720 --> 00:47:52,756
Now you can repay it.

717
00:47:52,880 --> 00:47:55,520
Do as I ask - don't fight these men!

718
00:47:55,640 --> 00:47:59,316
You owe her a debt, too? Damn, Iorek,
you're racking up debts faster than me.

719
00:47:59,440 --> 00:48:03,639
Heard there was some action occurring.
I thought I'd come see what's going on.

720
00:48:03,760 --> 00:48:05,319
Hello again, Mr Sysselman.

721
00:48:05,440 --> 00:48:06,954
Having fun? I hope so.

722

(GROANS)

723
00:48:08,800 --> 00:48:10,598
Just turn around.

724
00:48:10,720 --> 00:48:13,076
Walk away with me.

725
00:48:13,200 --> 00:48:14,395
Please.

726
00:48:14,520 --> 00:48:16,910
LEE: She's just a kid,
but she talks some sense.

727
00:48:17,040 --> 00:48:19,953
These people need our help, Iorek.
Let's go give it.

728
00:48:20,080 --> 00:48:21,639
This isn't who you are.

729

(REVERBERATING ROAR)

730
00:48:39,400 --> 00:48:40,754
(SIGHS)

731
00:49:00,280 --> 00:49:01,999
We're packed up.

732
00:49:02,120 --> 00:49:03,873
We're really going.

733
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:08,358
Lyra, trust me when I tell you,
it's within us to beat these people.

734
00:49:08,480 --> 00:49:10,517
Course it is,

735
00:49:10,640 --> 00:49:14,316
but would you mind if I brought
along a little extra help all the same?

736
00:49:17,360 --> 00:49:20,717
- How did you...?
- He's been mistreated and tricked,

737
00:49:20,840 --> 00:49:22,160
just like the Gyptians have been,

738
00:49:22,200 --> 00:49:25,750
always mistreated and tricked.

739
00:49:25,880 --> 00:49:27,519
He's practically Gyptian.

740
00:49:27,640 --> 00:49:29,836
- Just like I am.
- Lyra...

741
00:49:29,960 --> 00:49:31,997
You cannot constantly be
disobeying me.

742
00:49:32,120 --> 00:49:34,715
I agree.
Who wants a disobedient kid?

743
00:49:34,840 --> 00:49:36,035
But she's right.

744
00:49:36,160 --> 00:49:38,436
He's a good bear.
You won't have any trouble

745
00:49:38,560 --> 00:49:39,994
as long as you pay him.

746
00:49:40,120 --> 00:49:41,679
And me.

747
00:49:41,800 --> 00:49:43,996
And who's this?

748
00:49:46,800 --> 00:49:48,000
You told me he'd asked for me.

749
00:49:48,120 --> 00:49:50,351
No, I told you he'd be grateful for you.

750
00:49:50,480 --> 00:49:53,314
I was working on him already
being grateful. You've entirely

751
00:49:53,440 --> 00:49:56,035
- messed up my sales pitch.
- What did I tell you

752
00:49:56,160 --> 00:49:58,231
about how I play cards?

753
00:50:02,240 --> 00:50:04,038
Lee Scoresby.

754
00:50:04,160 --> 00:50:05,753
I can fight and I can fly.

755
00:50:05,880 --> 00:50:08,031
I don't come cheap,
and neither should I.

756
00:50:08,160 --> 00:50:10,197
You'll get gold for gold.

757
00:50:10,320 --> 00:50:13,438
And you are going to need
all the help you can get.

758
00:50:15,560 --> 00:50:21,158
He's an aeronaut. He has his own balloon.
He could be useful.

759
00:50:24,040 --> 00:50:28,034
Well, then,
welcome aboard, Lee Scoresby.

760
00:50:28,160 --> 00:50:31,119
We have a long and dangerous
journey ahead.

761
00:51:01,680 --> 00:51:03,194
Iofur?

762
00:51:05,480 --> 00:51:07,119
(CLATTERING)

763
00:51:08,520 --> 00:51:10,512
Iofur?

764
00:51:14,360 --> 00:51:15,874
Iofur.

765
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:19,437
I appreciate the need to keep
our meeting a secret,

766
00:51:19,560 --> 00:51:22,553
but it will be difficult
if I can't see you.

767
00:51:22,680 --> 00:51:24,319
Don't waste my time!

768
00:51:24,440 --> 00:51:25,874
No, no, of course.

769
00:51:27,280 --> 00:51:29,237
You... You are right.

770
00:51:30,400 --> 00:51:31,436
You are a king,

771
00:51:31,560 --> 00:51:33,472
and I am impertinent.

772
00:51:33,600 --> 00:51:35,193
I <i>am</i> a king,

773
00:51:35,320 --> 00:51:37,437
and you are not a queen.

774
00:51:41,640 --> 00:51:46,351
And we are very grateful
for your help in capturing Asriel.

775
00:51:46,480 --> 00:51:50,713
Many have tried,
and only you have succeeded.

776
00:51:50,840 --> 00:51:51,840
And yet I...

777
00:51:51,960 --> 00:51:55,476
Yet you doubt me.

778
00:51:55,600 --> 00:51:56,875
King Raknison,

779
00:51:57,000 --> 00:52:00,994
I was a great help in aiding you
in the disposal of Iorek Byrnison

780
00:52:01,120 --> 00:52:03,271
and helping you take your throne.

781
00:52:03,400 --> 00:52:07,553
And I agreed to capture Asriel
to repay my debt.

782
00:52:08,680 --> 00:52:12,515
But he is now <i>my</i> prisoner
in <i>my</i> dungeon,

783
00:52:12,640 --> 00:52:15,838
and I will do with him as I choose.

784
00:52:17,720 --> 00:52:19,677
Well, perhaps, then...

785
00:52:20,840 --> 00:52:24,117
...as an envoy from my people...

786
00:52:25,520 --> 00:52:28,433
...I could offer you something that
might be of worth to you.

787
00:52:28,560 --> 00:52:33,396
And in return, you may permit me
to oversee how you deal with Asriel...

788
00:52:33,520 --> 00:52:37,196
I am a king! I have all I need.

789
00:52:37,320 --> 00:52:39,391
I'm talking...

790
00:52:39,520 --> 00:52:41,716
...of a baptism.

791
00:52:41,840 --> 00:52:43,320
(GROWLS)

792
00:52:43,440 --> 00:52:45,352
Acceptance into the Magisterium.

793
00:52:45,480 --> 00:52:47,551
Baptism?

794
00:52:49,360 --> 00:52:50,760
King Iofur...

795
00:52:51,920 --> 00:52:53,639
...you are a great bear...

796
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:59,074
...and the Magisterium would be stronger
for having you part of it.

797
00:52:59,200 --> 00:53:00,554
Part of us.

798
00:53:03,640 --> 00:53:06,200
Will you walk the path with us?

799
00:53:07,320 --> 00:53:12,236
No bears have ever been brought
into the Magisterium before.

800
00:53:13,880 --> 00:53:17,669
You would be the first bear
to be baptised...

801
00:53:17,800 --> 00:53:20,076
...and the only.

802
00:53:20,200 --> 00:53:22,635
But do not mistake me,

803
00:53:22,760 --> 00:53:25,594
the honour would be ours.

804
00:53:25,720 --> 00:53:30,670
In return for which,
I will give them Asriel?

805
00:53:30,800 --> 00:53:33,440
No, you will keep him here,

806
00:53:33,560 --> 00:53:35,677
but you will ensure
his laboratory is destroyed

807
00:53:35,800 --> 00:53:38,599
and that his research into Dust
is erased.

808
00:53:38,720 --> 00:53:40,677
But <i>I</i> will control him.

809
00:53:42,080 --> 00:53:43,594
(GROWLS SOFTLY)

810
00:53:43,720 --> 00:53:46,235
I'm simply asking for you
to show your loyalty to us

811
00:53:46,360 --> 00:53:50,036
so that we may show
our loyalty to you.

812
00:53:51,120 --> 00:53:52,952
In the meantime,

813
00:53:53,080 --> 00:53:55,800
I'm sure you have much to attend to.

814
00:53:55,920 --> 00:53:58,674
How soon can this happen?

815
00:54:03,960 --> 00:54:07,078
The wheels have already
started turning.

816
00:54:07,200 --> 00:54:09,271
Asriel will be controlled.
