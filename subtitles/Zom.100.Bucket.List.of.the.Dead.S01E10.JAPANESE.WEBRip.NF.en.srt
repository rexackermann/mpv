1
00:00:03,503 --> 00:00:05,380
I think it's coming together.

2
00:00:06,089 --> 00:00:08,508
Akira, since your hair is short,

3
00:00:08,591 --> 00:00:10,927
we'll start by adding extensions
for volume

4
00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:14,806
and sew them into your natural hair
with an extension hook.

5
00:00:14,889 --> 00:00:20,311
Finally, we'll secure them by weaving in
any loose strands, and you're done!

6
00:00:25,525 --> 00:00:27,902
Starting today, I'm...

7
00:00:27,986 --> 00:00:30,155
Farmer Dreadlocks!

8
00:00:31,531 --> 00:00:33,992
5. TRY OUT DREADLOCKS

9
00:02:04,457 --> 00:02:07,794
I see. So you worked at a specialty salon
for over ten years?

10
00:02:07,877 --> 00:02:10,463
Yes, I was totally devoted to dreadlocks.

11
00:02:10,547 --> 00:02:14,926
So when I heard that Akira wanted
dreadlocks, I just had to help him out.

12
00:02:15,009 --> 00:02:17,679
I taught at a college in Tokyo.

13
00:02:17,762 --> 00:02:20,807
I was a makeup artist for films.

14
00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:24,519
Wow! Films? What did you work on?

15
00:02:24,602 --> 00:02:25,520
Let's see.

16
00:02:26,312 --> 00:02:28,064
{\an8}I did this one. Do you know it?

17
00:02:28,815 --> 00:02:32,569
I've seen this one! It was made in Japan?

18
00:02:32,652 --> 00:02:33,945
That's right!

19
00:02:34,028 --> 00:02:35,989
We were filming the sequel and...

20
00:02:41,411 --> 00:02:45,957
We were filming the sequel until that day.

21
00:02:47,292 --> 00:02:50,753
You'd never expect to be attacked
by real zombies

22
00:02:50,837 --> 00:02:54,757
while filming a zombie movie.

23
00:02:55,967 --> 00:02:57,427
<i>We took too long to notice.</i>

24
00:02:58,052 --> 00:02:59,220
<i>And so...</i>

25
00:03:00,346 --> 00:03:02,724
Mr. Nakayama, you're so convincing!

26
00:03:20,283 --> 00:03:25,580
So much happened along the way here.

27
00:03:26,581 --> 00:03:32,378
But everyone in the village
welcomed us with open arms.

28
00:03:33,296 --> 00:03:37,008
I can't thank them enough
for their kindness.

29
00:03:38,134 --> 00:03:42,388
And so, though it's just
wishful thinking for now,

30
00:03:42,472 --> 00:03:46,809
I'd like to continue living
in this village.

31
00:03:47,894 --> 00:03:49,854
That's how I truly feel.

32
00:03:54,484 --> 00:03:55,443
You're right!

33
00:04:06,246 --> 00:04:08,122
Thanks.

34
00:04:08,206 --> 00:04:11,084
It must be tough doing work
you're unaccustomed to.

35
00:04:11,668 --> 00:04:12,502
Not at all.

36
00:04:12,585 --> 00:04:14,921
The key to keeping
this village safe from zombies

37
00:04:15,004 --> 00:04:18,675
might come from using skills
from a time without electricity.

38
00:04:19,384 --> 00:04:22,929
I'm very interested
in how people live here.

39
00:04:24,472 --> 00:04:29,894
Well, I don't really get it,
but nothing beats rice cooked on a hearth.

40
00:04:29,978 --> 00:04:35,191
Add plenty of water and place it
on a roaring fire for the perfect rice.

41
00:04:35,275 --> 00:04:36,609
I see.

42
00:04:37,402 --> 00:04:40,571
I guess all that extra effort
makes it taste even better.

43
00:04:40,655 --> 00:04:42,073
Very interes...

44
00:04:42,156 --> 00:04:45,076
- Akemi!
- No!

45
00:04:45,159 --> 00:04:47,870
Cut it out, Old Man Hiko!

46
00:04:47,954 --> 00:04:51,541
You left me all alone!
Where have you been all this time?

47
00:04:52,667 --> 00:04:54,502
Sorry about that.

48
00:04:54,585 --> 00:04:58,214
He's been that way
ever since his old lady passed away.

49
00:04:58,298 --> 00:04:59,841
I see.

50
00:04:59,924 --> 00:05:03,303
- Akemi! Is dinner ready yet?
- He may not look it,

51
00:05:03,386 --> 00:05:06,764
but he used to be
the best hunter in this village.

52
00:05:06,848 --> 00:05:07,849
Hey, Tome.

53
00:05:08,474 --> 00:05:11,352
Have any rope or something you can spare?

54
00:05:11,436 --> 00:05:14,981
I was haying and sliced myself
with the scythe.

55
00:05:15,982 --> 00:05:18,234
How terrible!
I'll get you some right away.

56
00:05:18,318 --> 00:05:23,156
Try not to bind it too tightly
or you'll risk necrosis of the tissue.

57
00:05:24,073 --> 00:05:28,119
First, raise the injury above your heart
and after applying pressure to the area,

58
00:05:28,202 --> 00:05:30,663
then try applying pressure to the artery.

59
00:05:31,914 --> 00:05:34,876
You seem to know a lot about this.
Are you a doctor?

60
00:05:35,877 --> 00:05:36,794
No.

61
00:05:36,878 --> 00:05:40,923
When I was little, I was interested
in medicine, so I did some reading on it.

62
00:05:41,007 --> 00:05:42,884
What's this? A doctor?

63
00:05:42,967 --> 00:05:46,763
My back has been feeling worse
than usual since this morning.

64
00:05:46,846 --> 00:05:48,097
Like I said...

65
00:05:48,181 --> 00:05:50,391
What a young and beautiful doctor!

66
00:05:50,475 --> 00:05:52,894
I stumbled and hurt my knee.

67
00:05:52,977 --> 00:05:54,645
My stomach isn't feeling good.

68
00:05:54,729 --> 00:05:56,898
- I can't control my bladder.
- I'm constipated.

69
00:05:56,981 --> 00:05:59,400
Akemi!

70
00:05:59,484 --> 00:06:00,985
No!

71
00:06:01,069 --> 00:06:04,322
- I heard she's a doctor.
- How wonderful.

72
00:06:04,989 --> 00:06:07,408
Is that what I think it is?

73
00:06:07,492 --> 00:06:09,577
Is this a cesspit?

74
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:12,538
You don't see them
being used much nowadays,

75
00:06:12,622 --> 00:06:14,916
but it's a great source
for natural fertilizer.

76
00:06:15,583 --> 00:06:17,043
Fertilizer?

77
00:06:17,126 --> 00:06:21,047
In Japan, the rain washes away
a lot of the minerals from our fields.

78
00:06:21,130 --> 00:06:25,134
But if we recycle the food that we eat
by returning it to the soil,

79
00:06:25,218 --> 00:06:27,804
we can replenish those minerals.

80
00:06:28,304 --> 00:06:29,639
I see.

81
00:06:29,722 --> 00:06:34,143
They say a dive in the cesspit
will get you ahead in life.

82
00:06:34,227 --> 00:06:35,812
Want to give it a try, young man?

83
00:06:39,107 --> 00:06:40,149
Who is that girl?

84
00:06:41,526 --> 00:06:44,237
She escaped from the city.

85
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:50,952
She lost her parents and that dog
is the only family she has left.

86
00:06:51,786 --> 00:06:54,497
I haven't seen her smile once
since she got here.

87
00:06:55,248 --> 00:06:57,333
Such a young girl. Poor thing.

88
00:06:59,210 --> 00:07:01,504
Hey there, beautiful lady.

89
00:07:03,506 --> 00:07:06,634
I'm trying to become a comedian,
so I'm practicing my juggling.

90
00:07:06,717 --> 00:07:09,220
Would you care to watch?

91
00:07:12,181 --> 00:07:13,850
Why are you using <i>daruma?</i>

92
00:07:13,933 --> 00:07:17,311
Why? Because Gunma is known
for their <i>daruma.</i>

93
00:07:17,395 --> 00:07:19,897
Once I've perfected this,
I want to perform it naked.

94
00:07:19,981 --> 00:07:23,359
I'll be juggling so fast that
you won't see my crotch. So don't worry!

95
00:07:26,362 --> 00:07:28,614
Are you into little girls or something?

96
00:07:29,365 --> 00:07:31,701
Why are you even talking to me?

97
00:07:33,202 --> 00:07:35,371
It's common courtesy
to say hello to a lady,

98
00:07:35,455 --> 00:07:38,624
whether they're a girl or an old woman.

99
00:07:39,333 --> 00:07:40,376
Courtesy?

100
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:41,419
That's right!

101
00:07:41,502 --> 00:07:44,755
In Italy, you never forget
to smile at women,

102
00:07:44,839 --> 00:07:47,675
and it's considered rude
if you don't compliment women.

103
00:07:52,054 --> 00:07:56,350
You're so strange, Mister.
You're not even Italian.

104
00:07:56,976 --> 00:07:58,936
Looks like I finally got you to smile.

105
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:05,151
I'm Kencho!
What's your name, beautiful lady?

106
00:08:06,611 --> 00:08:09,030
Anju. And this is Charo.

107
00:08:10,072 --> 00:08:11,532
Then I'll call you Angie!

108
00:08:16,621 --> 00:08:19,207
Hey, could you watch me practice
my other acts?

109
00:08:19,290 --> 00:08:21,375
There's one where I eat udon with my butt!

110
00:08:21,459 --> 00:08:23,044
- I'll pass.
- What?

111
00:08:24,128 --> 00:08:25,296
<i>Wunderbar!</i>

112
00:08:25,379 --> 00:08:27,757
What a magnificent water wheel!

113
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,800
It's one of those hydroelectric ones.

114
00:08:29,884 --> 00:08:33,679
It produces the minimum amount
of electricity we need.

115
00:08:34,388 --> 00:08:36,140
Renewable energy.

116
00:08:36,224 --> 00:08:39,060
It's perfect for Nippon
with its abundant sources of water!

117
00:08:39,685 --> 00:08:44,315
Zombie bears and zombie boars
have been showing up in this area,

118
00:08:44,398 --> 00:08:47,151
so we've fortified our electrical fence
to keep them out.

119
00:08:47,235 --> 00:08:49,779
That's also powered by this.

120
00:08:49,862 --> 00:08:51,155
I see.

121
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:55,952
That said, this only gives you
a small shock if you touch it.

122
00:08:56,744 --> 00:08:57,828
By the way...

123
00:08:58,663 --> 00:09:02,917
Bea, make sure you don't touch this.

124
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,586
- What is it?
- It's an earth-leakage circuit breaker.

125
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:09,840
It shuts off the power
if there's an electric leak

126
00:09:09,924 --> 00:09:12,593
from the voltage
being cranked up too high.

127
00:09:12,677 --> 00:09:15,513
It's dangerous, so you mustn't touch it.

128
00:09:15,596 --> 00:09:17,682
<i>Ja!</i> Understood!

129
00:09:18,849 --> 00:09:20,851
Since living in this village,

130
00:09:20,935 --> 00:09:24,730
I've started thinking
about connections between people.

131
00:09:25,398 --> 00:09:28,484
Doing anything here takes time.

132
00:09:28,568 --> 00:09:31,237
<i>You can't survive
unless you help one another</i>

133
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:32,947
<i>because things aren't convenient.</i>

134
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:34,323
<i>It helps connect people.</i>

135
00:09:36,117 --> 00:09:38,578
<i>Here, you can see the work
that needs to be done,</i>

136
00:09:39,245 --> 00:09:41,038
<i>and you see the people who do it.</i>

137
00:09:41,622 --> 00:09:45,418
Unlike in the city,
things are limited here.

138
00:09:46,252 --> 00:09:51,173
Because they are limited, I'm thankful
and happy for whatever I can get.

139
00:09:51,257 --> 00:09:54,468
That's kinda what it feels like!

140
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:01,100
Hey, Akira!

141
00:10:02,268 --> 00:10:04,228
- Good job!
- Kencho!

142
00:10:04,312 --> 00:10:07,732
- You've been working the fields all day?
- Yeah. What about you?

143
00:10:07,815 --> 00:10:09,108
I slaughtered a chicken!

144
00:10:09,191 --> 00:10:11,861
I may never eat chicken again
because of the trauma.

145
00:10:11,944 --> 00:10:13,237
I know, right?

146
00:10:15,448 --> 00:10:16,866
Isn't that guy...

147
00:10:17,617 --> 00:10:18,909
Higurashi?

148
00:10:19,702 --> 00:10:22,079
Hey, Higurashi!

149
00:10:22,163 --> 00:10:24,165
You're still alive too?

150
00:10:24,248 --> 00:10:26,125
It's me! Ryuzaki!

151
00:10:26,792 --> 00:10:27,877
It's been a while.

152
00:10:33,966 --> 00:10:36,135
What? He left.

153
00:10:36,218 --> 00:10:38,804
- Who's Higurashi?
- Don't you remember?

154
00:10:38,888 --> 00:10:42,183
He was in our general education classes
at K University.

155
00:10:42,725 --> 00:10:44,852
He stopped showing up
after about six months

156
00:10:44,935 --> 00:10:47,813
Heard a rumor he became a NEET.

157
00:10:48,439 --> 00:10:51,025
Didn't expect to run into him here.

158
00:10:54,862 --> 00:10:57,406
Of all the damn people to run into...

159
00:11:01,869 --> 00:11:03,204
Damn it.

160
00:11:04,955 --> 00:11:07,583
It's been a while
since I've seen their annoying faces.

161
00:11:08,084 --> 00:11:11,420
They always looked like they were
having so much fun by themselves.

162
00:11:17,009 --> 00:11:20,179
Perfect. This is perfect.

163
00:11:28,479 --> 00:11:30,147
Hey, Dad!

164
00:11:31,524 --> 00:11:34,944
You wanna have a drink together?

165
00:11:36,195 --> 00:11:38,239
Sure. Don't see why not.

166
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:44,453
<i>What better way to give back to your dad
than sharing a drink together!</i>

167
00:11:46,872 --> 00:11:47,998
<i>Hold on.</i>

168
00:11:48,082 --> 00:11:51,210
<i>Have Dad's hands always been so thin?</i>

169
00:11:52,545 --> 00:11:55,631
<i>Looking closely, he's gotten more grey.</i>

170
00:11:56,674 --> 00:12:02,263
<i>After not seeing him for a while,
seems like he got smaller too.</i>

171
00:12:06,809 --> 00:12:08,352
Hey, Dad.

172
00:12:09,145 --> 00:12:10,271
What is it?

173
00:12:10,354 --> 00:12:13,524
After coming back to the village,
I've been thinking...

174
00:12:14,066 --> 00:12:20,739
When I was a kid, I idolized the big city,
but living here is not that bad.

175
00:12:20,823 --> 00:12:25,619
Besides, it must be tough
working that big field all by yourself.

176
00:12:25,703 --> 00:12:28,581
I'm sure Mom could use the extra help too.

177
00:12:29,582 --> 00:12:31,834
So I...

178
00:12:32,668 --> 00:12:36,213
What's the point in staying cooped up
in this small village?

179
00:12:38,299 --> 00:12:42,261
A man follows his dream,
the biggest one he can dream of.

180
00:12:44,597 --> 00:12:45,890
What the hell?

181
00:12:46,432 --> 00:12:48,476
I was trying to repay you both.

182
00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:53,731
You talk big,
but you're just a country farmer...

183
00:13:02,156 --> 00:13:06,160
What was your dream as a kid?

184
00:13:10,456 --> 00:13:11,624
Akira,

185
00:13:12,208 --> 00:13:16,795
haven't you ever wanted to see Earth
from the far reaches of space?

186
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:18,547
Space?

187
00:13:19,965 --> 00:13:26,722
Apparently, seeing our planet
from outer space is shocking to people.

188
00:13:27,389 --> 00:13:33,020
<i>Once you leave school and become an adult,
you realize how small your world was.</i>

189
00:13:33,687 --> 00:13:36,732
<i>Same as how you left
the village for Tokyo.</i>

190
00:13:36,815 --> 00:13:39,026
<i>It made you realize
how small your world was.</i>

191
00:13:39,610 --> 00:13:41,946
<i>Looking at the world from space,</i>

192
00:13:42,029 --> 00:13:45,282
<i>you don't see the equator line
or the lines that divide countries.</i>

193
00:13:46,283 --> 00:13:50,037
<i>You see how tiny your existence is
and that moves you.</i>

194
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:53,707
<i>Your existence on a tiny planet,
in the vastness of space...</i>

195
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:56,418
To tell you the truth,

196
00:13:57,461 --> 00:14:01,924
ever since I was a kid,
I've wanted to be an astronaut!

197
00:14:04,343 --> 00:14:05,177
What?

198
00:14:05,261 --> 00:14:11,433
Well, I'm just too dumb, so there's no way
that will happen at this point!

199
00:14:16,522 --> 00:14:18,691
What the hell?

200
00:14:18,774 --> 00:14:22,444
I had no idea you were such a joker!

201
00:14:24,113 --> 00:14:25,072
Yeah.

202
00:14:26,365 --> 00:14:29,410
Compared to 13,8 billion years
in the history of space,

203
00:14:29,493 --> 00:14:33,080
eighty years of life
isn't even a tenth of a second.

204
00:14:33,873 --> 00:14:36,208
So don't sell yourself short.

205
00:14:37,209 --> 00:14:41,046
Find your dream, Akira.
Biggest one you can.

206
00:14:42,298 --> 00:14:45,342
A man without a dream
is nothing more than a jellyfish.

207
00:14:48,929 --> 00:14:52,057
By the way Akira, not that it matters,

208
00:14:52,725 --> 00:14:55,853
but that hair doesn't look good
on you at all.

209
00:14:56,729 --> 00:14:57,605
Shut up!

210
00:14:59,189 --> 00:15:00,608
I wanted them!

211
00:15:05,946 --> 00:15:08,908
31. GO HOME AND SPEND TIME WITH MY PARENTS

212
00:15:32,389 --> 00:15:34,642
Sorry to keep you zombies waiting.

213
00:15:47,363 --> 00:15:48,614
Are you ready?

214
00:15:49,156 --> 00:15:50,282
- Yes.
- Yeah.

215
00:15:51,492 --> 00:15:52,952
The plan is simple.

216
00:15:53,035 --> 00:15:53,994
35. FUCK UP SOCIETY

217
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:58,040
Turn everyone in the village
into zombie food!

218
00:15:58,832 --> 00:16:01,502
Might as well get revenge
on those normies too.

219
00:16:01,627 --> 00:16:04,296
Just you wait, Akira.

220
00:16:14,181 --> 00:16:16,475
Hey, how many times
do I have to remind you?

221
00:16:16,558 --> 00:16:17,893
That's not a bathroom...

222
00:16:20,187 --> 00:16:22,022
What is it?

223
00:16:22,648 --> 00:16:24,108
Over there.

224
00:16:34,493 --> 00:16:36,662
What's the matter, Shizuka?

225
00:16:40,249 --> 00:16:42,167
- Dad.
- Yeah.

226
00:16:48,215 --> 00:16:50,050
What the hell is going on here?

227
00:17:03,522 --> 00:17:04,440
Akira!

228
00:17:04,982 --> 00:17:07,818
Leave your mother to me
and go to your friends.

229
00:17:07,901 --> 00:17:09,653
What? Dad?!

230
00:17:10,612 --> 00:17:13,657
Your friends have supported you
all the way here, right?

231
00:17:13,741 --> 00:17:14,908
Keep them safe.

232
00:17:25,044 --> 00:17:27,212
They're running so fast!
This is hilarious!

233
00:17:27,296 --> 00:17:29,214
Get the sick ones inside first!

234
00:17:29,298 --> 00:17:32,092
Lock the door and barricade it
the best you can!

235
00:17:39,683 --> 00:17:41,477
Are you all right, Shizuka?

236
00:17:42,936 --> 00:17:43,979
Yes.

237
00:17:45,773 --> 00:17:47,357
Hunting Club! Forward!

238
00:17:48,067 --> 00:17:49,193
Fire!

239
00:17:55,324 --> 00:17:56,241
It's no good!

240
00:17:56,325 --> 00:17:58,243
- There are too many!
- Let's fall back.

241
00:17:58,327 --> 00:17:59,411
This way!

242
00:17:59,495 --> 00:18:02,873
What's this? Going home already?

243
00:18:02,956 --> 00:18:05,125
The night is still young, you know.

244
00:18:05,876 --> 00:18:08,879
Let's play outside a little longer.

245
00:18:12,966 --> 00:18:14,593
5. BLOW SOMETHING UP WITH DYNAMITE

246
00:18:18,138 --> 00:18:19,848
3. FIRE A REAL GUN

247
00:18:20,641 --> 00:18:21,809
This is so horrible.

248
00:18:23,102 --> 00:18:24,269
I have to do something.

249
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:27,481
If this keeps up,
the village will be destroyed.

250
00:18:39,034 --> 00:18:40,994
Thanks for the save, Bea!

251
00:18:41,078 --> 00:18:43,247
No problem!

252
00:18:44,373 --> 00:18:45,833
- Kencho!
- Beatrix!

253
00:18:47,084 --> 00:18:49,336
Thank goodness! You're all okay!

254
00:18:49,419 --> 00:18:50,963
We'll talk later!

255
00:18:51,046 --> 00:18:53,549
We must get everyone
in the village out of here now.

256
00:18:53,632 --> 00:18:55,467
Get everyone to the suspension bridge!

257
00:18:55,551 --> 00:18:57,970
But there's an electric fence
around the village.

258
00:18:58,053 --> 00:19:02,349
It's just meant to deter zombie boars,
so the voltage shouldn't be dangerous.

259
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:04,726
Really?

260
00:19:05,936 --> 00:19:08,772
He's getting shocked pretty badly!

261
00:19:09,273 --> 00:19:10,983
To save someone from electrocution,

262
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:13,485
we need a non-conductive material
like wood

263
00:19:14,653 --> 00:19:16,280
to knock them away!

264
00:19:16,363 --> 00:19:17,990
I knew you could do it, Shizuka!

265
00:19:18,574 --> 00:19:19,658
That was a close one.

266
00:19:20,284 --> 00:19:23,328
But why is the voltage so high?

267
00:19:24,496 --> 00:19:25,497
Could it be?

268
00:19:25,581 --> 00:19:27,332
Did someone increase the voltage

269
00:19:27,416 --> 00:19:29,751
and disable
the earth-leakage circuit breaker?

270
00:19:29,835 --> 00:19:31,044
Hold on a second!

271
00:19:31,128 --> 00:19:34,298
So then the same electric fence
that protects the village

272
00:19:34,923 --> 00:19:37,426
from zombies is trapping us in?

273
00:19:39,511 --> 00:19:40,929
Hey!

274
00:19:42,014 --> 00:19:45,225
Akira! Ryuzaki!

275
00:19:46,393 --> 00:19:49,313
As expected, you guys sure are persistent!

276
00:19:50,022 --> 00:19:51,231
Higurashi?

277
00:19:53,525 --> 00:19:56,028
Hey! There are zombies behind you!

278
00:19:56,612 --> 00:19:57,946
Hey, they're coming!

279
00:19:59,072 --> 00:20:00,282
That guy is an idiot.

280
00:20:00,365 --> 00:20:02,701
I can't believe
he still hasn't figured it out.

281
00:20:05,245 --> 00:20:06,288
No way.

282
00:20:07,664 --> 00:20:10,209
You guys did this?

283
00:20:13,128 --> 00:20:15,214
That's correct!

284
00:20:16,798 --> 00:20:18,926
Why in the world would you do this?

285
00:20:22,763 --> 00:20:26,183
Well, we're all gonna be zombies one day.

286
00:20:26,266 --> 00:20:31,480
It'd be a shame if I didn't get to do
what I wanted before, right?

287
00:20:32,022 --> 00:20:33,315
That notebook...

288
00:20:33,398 --> 00:20:38,028
What? Were you making a list too?

289
00:20:38,111 --> 00:20:39,738
35. FUCK UP SOCIETY

290
00:20:39,821 --> 00:20:41,156
What a coincidence!

291
00:20:41,907 --> 00:20:45,619
What should I do next?

292
00:20:46,286 --> 00:20:47,955
Yeah, gotta be this one.

293
00:20:48,705 --> 00:20:53,877
Akira, I'd love to see you become
a zombie with my own eyes.

294
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:58,090
Screw you!
What did Akira do to you anyway?

295
00:20:58,173 --> 00:21:04,137
I've hated you
since the moment we met in college.

296
00:21:05,180 --> 00:21:07,724
<i>You didn't have a care in the world.</i>

297
00:21:07,808 --> 00:21:11,687
Enjoying life, each and every day.

298
00:21:11,770 --> 00:21:14,773
I couldn't help but be disgusted.

299
00:21:14,856 --> 00:21:16,775
That's your reason?

300
00:21:16,858 --> 00:21:20,237
This is our last summer break ever.

301
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:23,782
What's wrong with enjoying it
like you guys?

302
00:21:23,865 --> 00:21:26,910
- You bastard.
- You only live once.

303
00:21:27,411 --> 00:21:30,205
So enjoy life the way you want to.

304
00:21:31,581 --> 00:21:34,042
I get it because I'm doing that too.

305
00:21:35,752 --> 00:21:37,754
Akira, what are you say...

306
00:21:37,838 --> 00:21:43,927
If you're gonna put your freedom first,
you need to respect others' freedoms too.

307
00:21:44,678 --> 00:21:48,056
Stealing freedom from the villagers
who are struggling to survive...

308
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:49,933
That's what you want to do?

309
00:21:51,143 --> 00:21:54,187
I seriously don't understand
what you're saying.

310
00:21:57,024 --> 00:22:01,320
{\an8}Our bucket lists are nothing alike!

311
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:07,784
I still haven't repaid my parents
for raising me.

312
00:22:08,744 --> 00:22:12,414
{\an8}If I have to live with the regret
of not giving back to my parents,

313
00:22:12,497 --> 00:22:15,542
{\an8}I'd rather be eaten by zombies!

314
00:22:15,625 --> 00:22:16,960
{\an8}Nice.

315
00:22:17,044 --> 00:22:18,545
{\an8}That's what I want to hear!

316
00:22:18,670 --> 00:22:24,843
{\an8}It'll be a competition between you and me
to see who finishes their list first.

317
00:22:28,638 --> 00:22:31,475
{\an8}Akira, we'll be surrounded
by zombies at this rate!

318
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:33,477
{\an8}It's frustrating, but we must retreat!

319
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:36,229
{\an8}We need to evacuate
everyone in the village!

320
00:22:36,313 --> 00:22:37,481
{\an8}Charo?

321
00:22:37,564 --> 00:22:39,024
{\an8}I'll go to the water wheel shed!

322
00:22:39,107 --> 00:22:41,693
{\an8}I'll shut the generator
powering the electrical fence!

323
00:22:41,818 --> 00:22:44,154
{\an8}Then I'm going to give back to my parents!

324
00:22:44,237 --> 00:22:47,991
{\an8}Your goal seems to be different
from everyone else, but whatever.

325
00:22:48,075 --> 00:22:49,868
{\an8}We need to get everyone else.

326
00:22:50,035 --> 00:22:53,246
{\an8}Once the fence shuts off,
let's meet at the mountain bridge.

327
00:22:53,330 --> 00:22:54,247
Okay!

328
00:22:54,331 --> 00:22:56,708
Angie, don't leave my side, okay?

329
00:22:57,417 --> 00:22:58,460
Angie!

330
00:22:59,169 --> 00:23:00,712
Kencho! Over there!

331
00:23:01,338 --> 00:23:02,714
{\an8}What is she doing over there?

332
00:23:03,381 --> 00:23:04,633
{\an8}Leave her to me!

333
00:23:05,217 --> 00:23:06,885
{\an8}You go to your mom!

334
00:23:07,427 --> 00:23:08,553
{\an8}But...

335
00:23:10,347 --> 00:23:13,141
{\an8}We're definitely going to make it out
of this alive.

336
00:23:16,186 --> 00:23:17,354
{\an8}Yeah!

337
00:23:19,648 --> 00:23:21,608
{\an8}Is she going to stop the water wheel?

338
00:23:21,691 --> 00:23:23,401
Not on my watch!

339
00:23:24,945 --> 00:23:26,905
Go have fun, however you want.

340
00:23:28,990 --> 00:23:32,410
Let's drag out the villagers
hiding in their homes

341
00:23:32,494 --> 00:23:35,914
and turn every last one of them
into zombie food.

342
00:23:35,997 --> 00:23:39,167
A game of tag and then hide-and-seek.

343
00:23:39,251 --> 00:23:42,254
That's a pretty good start
to summer break!

344
00:23:46,216 --> 00:23:50,220
<i>Next Time: Hometown of the Dead II.</i>
