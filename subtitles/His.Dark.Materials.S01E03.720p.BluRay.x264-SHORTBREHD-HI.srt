I left Lyra with you.

She is here,

I never, never understood it either.

00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:37,591
Why does scholarship need protecting?

29
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:43,515
You don't believe original thinking
should be protected?

30
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:47,190
Well, if the thinking was clever enough,

31
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:53,032
it would find a way to obscure itself
from the Magisterium, wouldn't it?

32
00:03:55,920 --> 00:04:01,473
Scholastic sanctuary is just another way
of protecting bloated privilege.

you have been abusing your privilege.

Do you deny they're yours?

38
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:25,917
We do have ways of identifying
who last read them.

39
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:27,713

The only alethiometers in use
are sanctioned by the Magisterium.

so tell me where she is
or I will find the alethiometer.

You know I will.

48
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:04,277

(WHISPERS) Lyra.

52
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:19,872
She arrived in my care with it.

53
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,719
I merely returned it to her.

54
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:27,631

55

...or I will destroy all of this.

56
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:35,714
I kept her safe in this college
for 12 years.

57
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:37,752
I gave her to <i>you</i>
to look after,

58
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:39,473
and <i>you</i> lost her.

you can possibly do.

00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:58,918
Widen the search. She's not here.

62
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:13,835
I've never seen so many Gyptians.

63
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:18,234
Who are all of these people?

64
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:26,792
The Gyptians aren't just in Oxford,
you know, Lyra.

65
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:29,719
They've come from all over the country
to meet here in London

66
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:31,513
to find the missing children.

67
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:47,796
Tony, please, just explain
how you found her. From the beginning.

68
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:49,673
We were just out getting supplies.

69
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:51,359
What supplies?

70
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:54,996
Well, there was this van,
and then there was someone driving it,

71
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:57,237
and there was, like,
noises from the back -

72
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:58,589
muffled screaming and that.

73
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:02,270
Obviously, we was like,
"Yeah, we're going to have to stop it."

74
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:04,710
So we chased it and got lucky.

75
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:08,312
Tony rescued me, Ma Costa.

76
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:14,360
- I don't understand.
- I was just out with the guys, Ma!

77

78

Close isn't good enough, though, is it?

00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:33,394
It's a start.

85
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:37,235

Not as yet.

00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:30,751
- So, anything you saw?
- I didn't know where I was,

and I didn't know where
they were taking me.

I'm sorry. I wish I could be of more help.

so if we could talk again tomorrow...

- You're keeping me here?
- For your own safety.

99

00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:48,234
Why?

I don't know who you are!

to stay a prisoner again...

You may not know us,

105
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:58,959
but we know you, Lyra.

106
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:03,598
And have done since you were a baby.

107
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:06,030
JOHN FAA: You are not our prisoner, Lyra,

108
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:08,914
but you have always been
important to us.

109
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:12,038
Is this because of my father?

110
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:14,072
Because he's Lord Asriel?

111
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:18,719
Who told you that?

112
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:20,911
Your father was good to us.

113
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:24,158
He has always respected our way of life.

114
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:26,431
But you are special on your own account.

115
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:27,630
Why?

116
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:29,433
Frustrating as it may seem...

117
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:33,229
...that's not a question for me to answer.

118
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:35,795
I can't ask you to trust us, Lyra.

119
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:38,151
I can only hope we'll earn your trust.

120
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:43,400
We all want to find the missing children.
So... will you stay with us?

121
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:55,551
The girl needs to be found.
Mrs Coulter's quite insistent on it.

122

Any help that the Magisterium...

124

and this morning disrupted.

125
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:03,510
She did what she had to do.

126
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:06,200
She did it badly and baldly.

127

You said you'd give them a chance.

138

the Gobblers than we do.

139

We're more likely to find Roger
with them than on our own.

Pan, how do you know we'll be safe here?

00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:01,839
They want to get their children back.

142
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:05,272
I think we can trust them,

143
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:06,914
and I never thought that about her.

144
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:10,920
Well, I'll be better disguised
in their clothes than hers.

146
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:30,156

My friend Roger,

00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:55,477
he worked in kitchens.

155
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:57,114
Never thought you should learn?

- What good it do me?
- (LAUGHS)

157
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:03,837
Oh, a Gyptian woman learns more than just
cooking in our kitchens, Lyra Belacqua.

158
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:05,076
We're armed.

159
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:09,279
There you go, girl!

160
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:12,837
While you're stuck indoors,
we'll learn you some of our tricks.

161

There! Lesson one learned already.

162
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:20,158
You'll be a Gyptian woman yet.

Is that what I'm going to be -
a Gyptian woman?

164
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,719
You'll be whatever you want to be.

165

We just want to keep you safe.

172
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:07,077
Yeah, she said something similar
to me too.

00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:09,078
I'm sure she did.

Maybe she even meant it,

175

but maybe Mrs Coulter isn't as powerful
as she thinks.

of why she has a monkey daemon.

179
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:28,112
Then again, I'm often confused by daemons.

180
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:29,799
I would never have guessed

181
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:32,640
Tony Costa's daemon would have
settled as a hawk.

182
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:37,470
I think I'll settle as a mole.

183
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:38,636
Oh.

184
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:41,712
A mole, is it?

185
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:45,470
Yes, so he can burrow underground
and stay safe from all you grown-ups.

186
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:47,671
(CHUCKLES)

187
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:49,598
Very sensible.

188
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:53,834
But, er, not so good on the water, huh?

189
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:55,519
Nowhere to burrow.

190
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:57,916
(CHUCKLES)

191
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:02,592
I don't want Pantalaimon to settle.

192
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:07,351
I want him to be able to change for ever.

193
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:09,278
And so does he.

194
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:13,758
Well, there will come a time when you
will be tired of him changing.

195
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:18,716
When you come of age, and your daemon
settles into its final form,

196
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:22,197
it will reveal what kind of person
you really are.

197
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:28,520
Suppose you don't like the shape
that your daemon settles as?

198
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:34,557
Well, that would mean
you are discontented.

199
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:37,434
Many people would like
to have a lion as a daemon...

200
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:41,156
...and they end up with a poodle.

201
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:47,392
No, I would not change a hair on Sophonax,

202
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:52,470
but that is not to say that sometimes
I don't dream her different.

203
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:04,794
Now...

204
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:10,033
...would you like to see the man
who took you?

205
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:17,478
BENJAMIN: You people think you're so
clever, but we found you, didn't we?

206
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:22,231
There's no protection for you here.
Just me and you in a room.

207
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:25,593
Tell me where they are.

208
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:27,598
- (WHIMPERS)
- I know you know.

209
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:30,758
Tell me where they are
and why you've taken them.

210
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:32,633
FARDAR: Is this all right, Lyra?

211
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:34,160
BENJAMIN: Tell me.

212
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:36,112
Tell... me.

213
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:39,358
He wanted to do worse to Roger and Billy.

214
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:41,392
Why would they take them
and the other children

215
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:43,273
if it wasn't to hurt them?

216
00:17:10,840 --> 00:17:12,991
THOMAS: Grumman isn't who you think he is.

217
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:16,511
I ran a facial-recognition trace
based on your photo,

218
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:20,190
whatever that was,
and I found a match.

219
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:24,512
ColonelJohn Parry, 49th Commando.

220
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:27,917
Former marine and explorer,
presumed dead around 13 years ago.

221
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:29,759
He was lost in Alaska,

222
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:33,715
supporting a government-funded
science expedition, environmental thing.

223
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:35,877
He'd done a couple of gigs for them
before.

224
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:41,359
Prior to that, he was 14 years
in the Royal Marines.

225
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:44,439
He was born <i>here.</i>

226
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:46,392
In my world.

227
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:49,797
Charles, he didn't travel from your world
to mine.

228
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:52,640
- He travelled from my world to yours.
- Not possible.

229
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:54,956
He has a daemon, clearly, in the picture.

230
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:58,278
No-one is born in this world
with a daemon.

231
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:00,551
I don't think you know that.

232
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:10,396
Maybe you acquire a daemon
when you cross, or...

233
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:13,256
- Where precisely did he disappear?
- Look, this stuff was well locked up.

234
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:15,840
Somebody didn't want just anybody
poking about. He was a colonel.

235
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:19,231
But you're good, and you found out anyway.

236
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:23,792
I traced his ship.

237
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:26,479
Alaska.

238
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:29,354
The Brooks Range.

239
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:38,198
He's long gone from there by now.

240
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:40,471
- This is of no use to me.
- OK.

241
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:43,634
Maybe this might be.

242
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:46,919
He left a wife...

243
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:48,759
...and a child.

244
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:52,715
I found them on voter registration.

245
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:54,877
Maybe she'll know something.

246
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,231
But she's not well. Medical records.

247
00:18:57,360 --> 00:19:00,478
She's had a long-term history
of mental health problems.

248
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:06,959
This is a hard copy...

249
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:11,234
...of everything that I found.

250
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:16,240
It's all there.

251
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:21,596
Is this search just for you,

252
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:23,951
or whoever you work for?

253
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:29,035
It's just you, isn't it?

254
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:34,876
Why did you never try to follow me?

255
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:37,276
You could have.

256
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:39,995
You know enough to have crossed behind me.

257
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:42,476
You don't have the courage that's needed.

258
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:46,320
You don't want to find a window,
because you're scared of it.

259
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:51,510
It's true.

260
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:55,320
I was scared, too.

261
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:57,830
But I mastered my fear.

262
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:03,440
I never thought that I was
the only person to cross.

263
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:06,917
But until Stanislaus,
I never came across anyone

264
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:10,033
who was fearless enough to have done it.

265
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:15,799
I want to know what he knows,

266
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:17,274
I want to know where he crosses

267
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:19,915
and I want to know what he has seen.

268
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:25,078
This is very helpful.

269
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:28,554
I'll let myself out.

270
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:08,472
Is he saying anything?

271
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,400
He said she's taking them north,

272
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:16,876
- but he doesn't know where.
- Of course.

273
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,560
They can do anything
they want with them there.

274
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:23,310
But I saw, in her study, plans, papers.

275
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:27,195
- If we could just get to them...
- No! We are not going to Mrs Coulter!

276
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:30,040
- Maybe we could...
- Mrs Coulter cannot know where we are.

277
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:33,153
If you got captured,
we'd risk her knowing everything.

went exploring all over the North.

Your ma, she was already married.

343

As soon as they met, they fell in love.

344
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:29,716
When she was pregnant with you,
they thought they could get away with it,

345

but soon as you was born,
there was no hiding the Asriel in you.

in the care of a Gyptian nurse.

Well, I was told that you frame a question

to another symbol
