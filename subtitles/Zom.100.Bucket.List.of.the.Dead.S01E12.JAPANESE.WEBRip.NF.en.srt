00:00:04,421 --> 00:00:07,924
{\an8}<i>When I was in elementary school,
I had friends just like everyone else.</i>

2
00:00:08,008 --> 00:00:09,467
GROUNDS
PUBLIC POOL

3
00:00:09,634 --> 00:00:14,973
<i>During summer break, we'd play
at the public pool every day until sunset.</i>

4
00:00:16,224 --> 00:00:20,186
<i>Thinking back on it,
my life peaked back then.</i>

5
00:00:24,274 --> 00:00:25,942
<i>When I got to middle school,</i>

6
00:00:26,776 --> 00:00:29,571
<i>everyone began to notice
I was naturally an introvert.</i>

7
00:00:30,155 --> 00:00:32,949
<i>Before I knew it,
I was on the outside looking in.</i>

8
00:00:34,784 --> 00:00:38,747
<i>During my three years in high school,
I didn't talk to anyone</i>

9
00:00:38,830 --> 00:00:41,791
<i>and spent my time reading
while listening to Rakugo stories.</i>

10
00:00:42,792 --> 00:00:45,378
<i>In college, I tried to change myself.</i>

11
00:00:45,462 --> 00:00:46,713
<i>I did an overseas internship.</i>

12
00:00:46,796 --> 00:00:48,214
<i>I was a student volunteer.</i>

13
00:00:48,298 --> 00:00:51,593
<i>And I even took
a personal development seminar.</i>

14
00:00:52,510 --> 00:00:57,724
<i>But to everyone else, I was just an empty,
visionless, self-conscious idiot.</i>

15
00:00:58,349 --> 00:00:59,517
<i>To be fair, I didn't know</i>

16
00:00:59,601 --> 00:01:03,313
<i>- what I wanted to do with myself.</i>
- They'll upsize beef bowls for free!

17
00:01:03,396 --> 00:01:05,482
What? For real?

18
00:01:05,565 --> 00:01:07,567
We have to go! I could eat three bowls!

19
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:10,487
You're definitely going
to barf them up during practice.

20
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:13,698
It's fine! I'll be fine this time!

21
00:01:13,782 --> 00:01:16,117
Didn't you say something like that before?

22
00:01:16,201 --> 00:01:19,245
- That was five servings of pasta.
<i>- He should have been like me.</i>

23
00:01:19,329 --> 00:01:22,749
<i>- Empty, visionless, lacking ambition.</i>
- No way. That would be six bowls!

24
00:01:22,832 --> 00:01:24,292
<i>- But he...</i>
- Nope, I can do it today!

25
00:01:24,375 --> 00:01:28,713
<i>...cruised through life
without a care in the world.</i>

26
00:01:28,797 --> 00:01:30,632
<i>He's always enjoying himself!</i>

27
00:01:32,050 --> 00:01:35,512
<i>And I just couldn't help but despise him.</i>

28
00:01:36,888 --> 00:01:38,014
What's the matter?

29
00:01:38,097 --> 00:01:40,266
Come on out already.

30
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:45,396
Your dad is weeping
over what a good son he has!

31
00:01:45,897 --> 00:01:47,774
<i>I have to save Dad!</i>

32
00:01:47,857 --> 00:01:50,610
<i>But that means I need to become a zombie?</i>

33
00:01:51,236 --> 00:01:52,487
<i>What am I supposed to do?</i>

34
00:01:52,570 --> 00:01:56,449
Don't you dare open that door, Akira.

35
00:01:57,867 --> 00:02:04,666
If you put your mom in danger
and make me watch my own kid die,

36
00:02:04,749 --> 00:02:09,546
we're no longer family.

37
00:02:09,629 --> 00:02:12,715
But if I don't do anything,
you're going to...

38
00:02:12,799 --> 00:02:16,177
Don't worry about me, Akira.

39
00:02:16,719 --> 00:02:20,765
Either way, I don't have long left.

40
00:02:22,934 --> 00:02:24,185
What?

41
00:02:24,269 --> 00:02:28,606
Your father has got one of those
bad growths on his body.

42
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:31,818
With everything that's happening,
there are no doctors or medicine...

43
00:02:31,901 --> 00:02:33,444
There's no way to treat it.

44
00:02:33,987 --> 00:02:36,114
Sooner or later,
it'll be too late for him.

45
00:02:36,197 --> 00:02:38,283
But you don't know that for sure.

46
00:02:38,908 --> 00:02:41,870
If we search for a doctor,
we might find one right away.

47
00:02:41,953 --> 00:02:46,291
And a vaccine to deal with the zombies
could be developed tomorrow!

48
00:02:47,041 --> 00:02:50,753
At this rate, I'll never
have a chance to show you my gratitude.

49
00:02:52,171 --> 00:02:53,131
Akira,

50
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:56,759
help humanity.

51
00:02:58,678 --> 00:03:00,555
Do what you can for the world.

52
00:03:01,306 --> 00:03:03,892
Don't lie for your own sake.

53
00:03:04,809 --> 00:03:07,437
Show others empathy.

54
00:03:08,396 --> 00:03:12,483
You can give back to us,
even if we're gone.

55
00:03:13,276 --> 00:03:18,698
To see you living strong
from up in heaven...

56
00:03:19,407 --> 00:03:23,578
There's nothing
that would make me prouder.

57
00:03:28,041 --> 00:03:31,920
<i>Haven't you ever wanted to see Earth
from the far reaches of space?</i>

58
00:03:32,003 --> 00:03:34,422
<i>Take care of your mom.</i>

59
00:03:34,505 --> 00:03:35,757
<i>Thanks for worrying about me.</i>

60
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:38,134
<i>But aren't you exhausted
from your long journey?</i>

61
00:03:38,218 --> 00:03:40,220
<i>I was a makeup artist for films.</i>

62
00:03:40,303 --> 00:03:42,805
<i>You'd never expect to be attacked
by real zombies.</i>

63
00:03:50,313 --> 00:03:53,149
It doesn't seem like he's coming out.

64
00:03:54,275 --> 00:03:58,780
I guess some half-dead old guy
isn't much of a hostage.

65
00:04:32,105 --> 00:04:34,232
You damned fool!

66
00:04:34,315 --> 00:04:36,067
I did it!

67
00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:37,485
Finally!

68
00:04:37,568 --> 00:04:42,240
I turned the person I hate the most
into a zombie!

69
00:04:42,323 --> 00:04:45,368
Look at you!

70
00:04:45,451 --> 00:04:50,123
Now I'll never have to see
that dumbass smile of yours again!

71
00:04:50,832 --> 00:04:56,004
The fun times are over for you,
and you can't do what you want anymore!

72
00:04:56,087 --> 00:04:58,214
I win!

73
00:05:02,468 --> 00:05:04,721
{\an8}100 THINGS WE WANT TO DO
BEFORE BECOMING ZOMBIES

74
00:05:08,016 --> 00:05:09,642
What?

75
00:05:10,977 --> 00:05:12,270
What is this?

76
00:05:13,229 --> 00:05:19,110
What the hell is going on?

77
00:05:20,153 --> 00:05:21,279
I'm sorry.

78
00:05:21,738 --> 00:05:25,992
This is a risky plan, but I'd like to ask
everyone for their help.

79
00:05:28,828 --> 00:05:32,790
We'll create dark recesses for your eyes,
hollow out your cheeks, make some bruises...

80
00:05:33,291 --> 00:05:36,753
For the blood, we'll make it sticky
by adding laundry detergent.

81
00:05:37,253 --> 00:05:40,006
For discolored teeth,
we'll use brown alcohol based ink.

82
00:05:40,506 --> 00:05:42,675
Finally, we'll give you white contacts!

83
00:05:45,428 --> 00:05:48,389
I totally look like a zombie!

84
00:05:48,473 --> 00:05:49,515
22. ATTEMPT COSPLAY

85
00:06:05,031 --> 00:06:07,283
It's all up to you, Akira!

86
00:06:07,784 --> 00:06:08,951
I got this!

87
00:06:12,497 --> 00:06:14,373
Are you all right, Dad?

88
00:06:14,457 --> 00:06:18,294
Yeah. I can still move.

89
00:06:20,171 --> 00:06:21,297
Damn it!

90
00:06:22,381 --> 00:06:23,549
Damn it!

91
00:06:25,176 --> 00:06:29,931
Higurashi, what did you
want to do, anyway?

92
00:06:30,014 --> 00:06:31,766
The same thing as you!

93
00:06:31,849 --> 00:06:34,852
{\an8}To do whatever I wanted!
Anything I wanted!

94
00:06:34,936 --> 00:06:38,564
{\an8}Is it so wrong for me
to have some fun for once?

95
00:06:40,525 --> 00:06:44,112
If this is really what you wanted to do...

96
00:06:46,155 --> 00:06:49,450
then why didn't you look like
you were having any fun?

97
00:06:52,662 --> 00:06:54,580
Of course I'm having fun!

98
00:06:54,664 --> 00:06:56,207
This is exactly what I...

99
00:06:57,208 --> 00:06:59,669
<i>wanted to do?</i>

100
00:07:00,336 --> 00:07:02,463
Higurashi. Higurashi!

101
00:07:02,547 --> 00:07:03,464
What is it?

102
00:07:06,551 --> 00:07:10,471
What the hell have you done?

103
00:07:10,555 --> 00:07:14,475
Damn it!

104
00:07:14,559 --> 00:07:17,478
Damn it!

105
00:07:19,313 --> 00:07:20,565
God damn it all!

106
00:07:22,942 --> 00:07:24,735
Let's go, Akira.

107
00:07:24,819 --> 00:07:26,737
The zombies are already coming this way.

108
00:07:37,165 --> 00:07:38,374
What's on your real list?

109
00:07:39,542 --> 00:07:44,297
What did you want to write down
on your real bucket list, Higurashi?

110
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:51,262
The thing I really wanted to do...

111
00:07:52,513 --> 00:07:54,849
Whoa! Watch out for the water!

112
00:07:56,392 --> 00:07:57,727
That was a huge dive.

113
00:07:57,810 --> 00:07:58,895
I lost.

114
00:07:58,978 --> 00:08:00,313
All right!

115
00:08:05,485 --> 00:08:07,778
You went overboard, Higurashi!

116
00:08:16,746 --> 00:08:20,958
All I wanted to do...

117
00:08:23,628 --> 00:08:27,924
was have fun
at the public pool with my friends.

118
00:08:31,385 --> 00:08:34,680
If that's all, then,
you were a fool, Higurashi.

119
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:40,186
Nope, I can do it today!
It's because I didn't have breakfast yet!

120
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:55,159
You're in the same Gen-Ed program
as me, aren't you?

121
00:08:55,243 --> 00:08:57,370
If you're hungry, want to come with us?

122
00:09:02,291 --> 00:09:05,419
What's with that guy?
He left without saying anything.

123
00:09:05,503 --> 00:09:07,713
Let's get going already.
They might run out!

124
00:09:09,882 --> 00:09:12,510
<i>You should have just told us...</i>

125
00:09:15,179 --> 00:09:17,306
what you wanted back then.

126
00:09:20,893 --> 00:09:24,730
If the time comes
when I really become a zombie,

127
00:09:25,439 --> 00:09:28,776
let's go to the pool together, okay?

128
00:09:35,825 --> 00:09:39,412
25. GIVE FREE HUGS

129
00:09:59,932 --> 00:10:01,058
Let's go.

130
00:10:14,614 --> 00:10:16,574
GROUNDS
PUBLIC POOL

131
00:10:52,485 --> 00:10:53,569
Hey!

132
00:10:53,653 --> 00:10:56,155
Akiko and everyone! Are you all right?

133
00:10:57,448 --> 00:10:59,200
Is that you, Kencho?

134
00:10:59,283 --> 00:11:02,036
Akira! Why are you a zombie?

135
00:11:02,119 --> 00:11:03,412
Something stinks!

136
00:11:03,496 --> 00:11:05,206
Everyone! You're all right!

137
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:08,250
This is everyone from the village.

138
00:11:10,795 --> 00:11:11,712
This is bad.

139
00:11:11,796 --> 00:11:13,422
We need to get out of here now!

140
00:11:13,506 --> 00:11:16,175
But how can we get past this fence?

141
00:11:16,801 --> 00:11:19,845
Everyone! Out of the way please!

142
00:11:21,347 --> 00:11:22,223
Bea?

143
00:11:22,306 --> 00:11:26,977
I can't seem to get down, so I must
crash this into the electrical fence!

144
00:11:28,062 --> 00:11:31,482
Everyone! Get away from the fence
and open up a path!

145
00:11:31,565 --> 00:11:34,693
All healthy bodies,
give the old folks a hand!

146
00:11:34,777 --> 00:11:35,611
Leave it to us!

147
00:11:35,694 --> 00:11:36,612
Here I go!

148
00:11:37,905 --> 00:11:38,739
Now!

149
00:11:38,823 --> 00:11:41,450
Everyone, run!

150
00:11:53,337 --> 00:11:56,006
Just a little further
until the suspension bridge!

151
00:12:04,723 --> 00:12:05,641
No way.

152
00:12:06,267 --> 00:12:07,810
The suspension bridge...

153
00:12:07,893 --> 00:12:10,312
It was our only way out.

154
00:12:17,361 --> 00:12:18,320
Damn it!

155
00:12:18,404 --> 00:12:19,864
Isn't there anything we can do?

156
00:12:21,323 --> 00:12:22,658
Hey, guys!

157
00:12:23,868 --> 00:12:26,287
Take this!

158
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,793
You're...

159
00:12:32,877 --> 00:12:34,170
Mr. Kumano!

160
00:12:34,670 --> 00:12:37,339
I came to see what the zombies
were up in arms about

161
00:12:37,423 --> 00:12:39,800
only to see your bridge was out!

162
00:12:39,884 --> 00:12:42,386
I built you a brand new one in a jiffy!

163
00:12:44,638 --> 00:12:48,559
I told you I'd help you out
if you ran into any trouble!

164
00:12:53,147 --> 00:12:54,315
They're already here!

165
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:58,068
We'll hold up the bridge!

166
00:12:58,152 --> 00:13:00,821
Get across now!

167
00:13:02,907 --> 00:13:04,825
Hurry!

168
00:13:04,909 --> 00:13:07,328
Hurry!

169
00:13:07,411 --> 00:13:09,330
Everyone got across!

170
00:13:11,165 --> 00:13:12,958
You ready for this, Kencho?

171
00:13:13,042 --> 00:13:14,710
You bet, Akira!

172
00:13:22,718 --> 00:13:24,303
This is super scary!

173
00:13:24,386 --> 00:13:25,888
This is super scary!

174
00:13:41,612 --> 00:13:43,113
- Ouch!
- Ouch!

175
00:13:56,460 --> 00:13:58,837
He just wanted friends?

176
00:13:59,713 --> 00:14:05,302
If that's really all Higurashi wanted,
then he's a god damned fool.

177
00:14:05,886 --> 00:14:07,263
Yeah.

178
00:14:07,763 --> 00:14:11,267
But when I was working
for that exploitative company,

179
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:13,018
I also lost sight of myself.

180
00:14:13,602 --> 00:14:18,190
Every day was so painful
and I didn't know what I was living for.

181
00:14:19,316 --> 00:14:25,531
If I had wanted to make my own
twisted list like that black notebook,

182
00:14:26,615 --> 00:14:27,616
I could have.

183
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:30,160
Anyone could've become like Higurashi.

184
00:14:31,453 --> 00:14:35,916
So despite everything, I can't hate him.

185
00:14:38,127 --> 00:14:40,296
There we go.

186
00:14:44,633 --> 00:14:46,677
Good job, Akira.

187
00:14:47,845 --> 00:14:52,099
Without you, your mom and everyone
in the village wouldn't be here.

188
00:14:53,767 --> 00:14:57,187
I'm proud of you, son!

189
00:15:00,441 --> 00:15:03,903
So, does this mean I was able
to repay you just a little?

190
00:15:09,241 --> 00:15:12,328
38. GIVE BACK TO MY PARENTS

191
00:15:14,955 --> 00:15:16,457
Now! Seal it off!

192
00:15:17,583 --> 00:15:19,251
Are those all the zombies?

193
00:15:19,335 --> 00:15:21,545
We searched every inch of the village!

194
00:15:21,629 --> 00:15:23,172
There's no mistaking!

195
00:15:26,884 --> 00:15:29,136
You're planning on restarting here
in the village?

196
00:15:29,803 --> 00:15:33,140
Well, we only have one hometown.

197
00:15:34,516 --> 00:15:39,980
Now that Mr. Kumano has moved here
and is leading the rebuilding,

198
00:15:40,064 --> 00:15:42,608
everyone is peppier than ever.

199
00:15:42,691 --> 00:15:45,194
It seems like
they got a second shot at life.

200
00:15:45,694 --> 00:15:50,199
I expect it won't be long before the
village is back to the way it was before.

201
00:15:52,368 --> 00:15:54,078
It's all thanks to you.

202
00:15:54,787 --> 00:15:57,665
You were our village doctor, remember?

203
00:15:57,748 --> 00:16:00,751
Not really! I'm not even a doctor!

204
00:16:01,752 --> 00:16:05,506
You cured us old whiners
when we were ready to give in.

205
00:16:06,048 --> 00:16:08,717
I can't thank you enough.

206
00:16:13,013 --> 00:16:14,473
- Hold this.
- Okay.

207
00:16:17,267 --> 00:16:20,437
Steadier! Otherwise,
we won't finish before dinner!

208
00:16:21,105 --> 00:16:21,981
Okay!

209
00:16:24,316 --> 00:16:26,986
Angie, you're like
an entirely different person.

210
00:16:28,070 --> 00:16:30,614
Crying won't repair this fence!

211
00:16:31,156 --> 00:16:34,243
And besides, I don't want
to keep crying over zombies.

212
00:16:34,326 --> 00:16:37,955
I was able to move forward
because a funny guy got me to smile.

213
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:42,501
Thank you, Mr. Stand-Up Comic!

214
00:16:45,337 --> 00:16:47,256
34. BECOME A STAND-UP COMIC

215
00:16:57,975 --> 00:16:59,476
He's sleeping well.

216
00:17:01,895 --> 00:17:05,149
He wore himself ragged up until now...

217
00:17:05,733 --> 00:17:08,944
Everyday he'd ask me,

218
00:17:09,570 --> 00:17:14,616
"Have we heard from Akira yet?"
"Is Akira doing all right?"

219
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:19,580
Well, in a world full of zombies,
even a curmudgeon like Dad would...

220
00:17:19,663 --> 00:17:21,165
No, not that!

221
00:17:21,248 --> 00:17:24,168
He started asking the day after
you left for Tokyo.

222
00:17:33,969 --> 00:17:35,429
If...

223
00:17:36,305 --> 00:17:40,059
I'm not saying that it will, but...

224
00:17:41,226 --> 00:17:45,147
If anything happens to you, Dad,
I promise that I'll always

225
00:17:46,315 --> 00:17:48,317
keep Mom and the village safe!

226
00:17:49,026 --> 00:17:52,071
I'll do it for you, Dad!

227
00:17:57,701 --> 00:18:01,538
By the way, what does Dad have?

228
00:18:04,666 --> 00:18:05,793
Hemorrhoids?

229
00:18:06,418 --> 00:18:09,505
- That's it? Hemorrhoids?
- That's right!

230
00:18:09,588 --> 00:18:10,464
<i>Hemorrhoids?</i>

231
00:18:10,547 --> 00:18:13,300
He hates hospitals,
so he didn't get them treated.

232
00:18:13,383 --> 00:18:15,636
So now, the bleeding is really bad.

233
00:18:15,719 --> 00:18:17,888
The pain is so terrible
that he can't stand.

234
00:18:17,971 --> 00:18:19,223
It's awful.

235
00:18:20,099 --> 00:18:22,476
So then why is he wheezing?

236
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:26,271
Lately, it's been considerably hot
in the countryside, even at night.

237
00:18:26,355 --> 00:18:28,690
It makes it difficult
for old-timers to sleep.

238
00:18:28,774 --> 00:18:31,360
But we can't ignore hemorrhoids!

239
00:18:31,443 --> 00:18:36,740
If we leave them alone, they could lead
to a life-threatening infection!

240
00:18:40,244 --> 00:18:43,122
I see. It's just hemorrhoids.

241
00:18:45,749 --> 00:18:47,292
<i>Find your dream, Akira.</i>

242
00:18:48,085 --> 00:18:49,962
<i>Biggest one you can.</i>

243
00:18:50,838 --> 00:18:54,174
<i>A man without a dream
is nothing more than a jellyfish.</i>

244
00:18:56,969 --> 00:19:01,223
If that's the case, I think it's time
for me to leave the village.

245
00:19:02,891 --> 00:19:04,351
What about the village?

246
00:19:04,810 --> 00:19:08,730
Akira, what do you wish to do
outside of the village?

247
00:19:08,814 --> 00:19:13,277
If the zombies are caused
by a virus like Shizuka says,

248
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:18,532
I'll travel the country and look for a way
to stop the infection.

249
00:19:18,657 --> 00:19:22,244
Then I'll convince Dad
to get surgery for his hemorrhoids!

250
00:19:25,581 --> 00:19:29,084
"Help humanity."
"Do what you can for the world."

251
00:19:29,168 --> 00:19:31,253
Those were Dad's last wishes after all!

252
00:19:31,336 --> 00:19:33,672
<i>- He's still alive though.
- He's still alive though.</i>

253
00:19:33,755 --> 00:19:35,507
Saving the world.

254
00:19:36,133 --> 00:19:37,843
That's wild.

255
00:19:39,761 --> 00:19:41,221
It's a big dream.

256
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:42,848
I like it!

257
00:19:53,108 --> 00:19:54,526
40. MAKE DAD GET SURGERY

258
00:19:55,027 --> 00:19:56,195
What about all of you?

259
00:19:57,321 --> 00:19:59,156
Is there anything you want to add?

260
00:20:04,244 --> 00:20:05,871
In that case, I'm adding one.

261
00:20:05,954 --> 00:20:11,168
I'm sure there are lots of people across
Japan who are crying like Angie!

262
00:20:11,251 --> 00:20:14,421
This time,
I want to fulfill my childhood dream!

263
00:20:14,504 --> 00:20:15,422
42. BECOME A DOCTOR

264
00:20:15,505 --> 00:20:19,301
So far, I've only toured
the zombie infested parts of Nippon.

265
00:20:19,384 --> 00:20:20,886
43. RESTORE NIPPON'S NATURAL BEAUTY

266
00:20:20,969 --> 00:20:22,304
Very nice!

267
00:20:22,387 --> 00:20:25,682
Let's keep it up and write all the things
we'd like to do across Japan!

268
00:20:25,766 --> 00:20:27,434
I want to party on a cruise ship!

269
00:20:27,517 --> 00:20:29,186
I want to swim with dolphins!

270
00:20:29,269 --> 00:20:31,438
I want to live in a castle!

271
00:20:31,521 --> 00:20:34,566
- How about a waterfall meditation?
- I want to ride an ostrich!

272
00:20:34,650 --> 00:20:37,694
I've always wanted
to eat Yobuko squid served live!

273
00:20:37,778 --> 00:20:40,530
I want to experience
<i>hatsumōde</i> at Ise Shrine.

274
00:20:40,656 --> 00:20:43,158
- Me too!
- Nice one!

275
00:20:43,242 --> 00:20:44,618
We can do that!

276
00:20:47,829 --> 00:20:49,122
Got enough water?

277
00:20:49,206 --> 00:20:50,749
Take some vegetables too!

278
00:20:50,832 --> 00:20:52,960
It's going to get colder from here on.

279
00:20:53,043 --> 00:20:55,170
Take whatever you need.

280
00:20:55,254 --> 00:20:56,755
Thank you so much!

281
00:20:56,838 --> 00:20:58,340
Akemi!

282
00:20:59,049 --> 00:21:03,220
I'll always be waiting
for you to come back, you hear?

283
00:21:03,303 --> 00:21:07,975
Old Man Hiko, I'm not Akemi.

284
00:21:08,433 --> 00:21:09,726
I'm Shizuka.

285
00:21:14,022 --> 00:21:16,358
It's going to get lonely, isn't it?

286
00:21:16,858 --> 00:21:23,532
I think it's okay to cry in front of him
since you're saying goodbye.

287
00:21:35,544 --> 00:21:36,878
Mr. Kencho!

288
00:21:38,755 --> 00:21:43,176
When you come back, show me
how you slurp udon with your butt!

289
00:21:46,722 --> 00:21:47,681
Enough already!

290
00:21:47,764 --> 00:21:50,434
We don't need this much simmered seaweed!

291
00:21:50,517 --> 00:21:51,810
It's fine. Just take it.

292
00:21:51,893 --> 00:21:53,812
It'll keep!

293
00:21:53,895 --> 00:21:59,067
I don't like the idea of you
going hungry somewhere.

294
00:21:59,151 --> 00:22:00,402
Mom.

295
00:22:00,902 --> 00:22:02,321
Akira!

296
00:22:02,404 --> 00:22:04,364
Leave your mother to me!

297
00:22:10,704 --> 00:22:11,830
Okay, everyone!

298
00:22:11,913 --> 00:22:13,915
We're just going to go

299
00:22:14,958 --> 00:22:17,252
{\an8}and save the world!

300
00:22:17,336 --> 00:22:18,545
6. TRAVEL AROUND THE COUNTRY

301
00:22:18,628 --> 00:22:20,005
So, what's the plan, Akira?

302
00:22:20,130 --> 00:22:22,883
Stopping a virus means
we'll need a vaccine, right?

303
00:22:22,966 --> 00:22:26,928
Are we heading to an infectious disease
research lab? A U.S. military base?

304
00:22:27,012 --> 00:22:29,014
- We'll go north!
- North?

305
00:22:29,097 --> 00:22:31,600
Because all good travelers venture north!

306
00:22:31,683 --> 00:22:34,061
{\an8}Isn't it exciting?

307
00:23:09,179 --> 00:23:12,516
{\an8}Is it just me, or does it seem like
we're just sightseeing?

308
00:23:12,599 --> 00:23:15,310
{\an8}Are we really searching for a solution?

309
00:23:15,393 --> 00:23:17,229
{\an8}I think it's all good!

310
00:23:18,522 --> 00:23:20,107
Hey, it's coming into view!

311
00:23:20,565 --> 00:23:22,109
The Seikan Tunnel!

312
00:23:22,984 --> 00:23:26,446
All right! Next up is Hokkaido!

313
00:23:26,530 --> 00:23:29,324
Sounds good to me!
