I'm sure you've guessed already.

00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:50,437
I wasn't in Oxford by chance.

245
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:00,675
I have urgent information
about your husband.

246
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:05,720
And I can't say it to you on your porch.

247
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:07,274
Where's your lounge?

248
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:35,834
What a pleasant room.

249
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:39,675
It's strange.

00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:44,238
Some houses you walk into
and you know they're not happy places.

or something indescribable,

the opportunity to do some...

...some intelligence work.

262
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:33,233
So, MI5, MI6?

263

Maybe we don't need
to answer that question.

- Tell me what you know aboutJohn.
- We're concerned.

We believe that before he disappeared

266
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:57,474
he was entangled in something nasty.

And your husband's name
keeps getting brought up.

272
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:12,437
What objects?

273
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:16,793
What if I told you there was
a possibility, albeit slight,

274
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:19,480
that we might,
with the right information,

275
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:21,910
be able to find John himself?

276
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:24,759

I'm not talking about his corpse.

278
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:32,719
And if our information is correct...

279
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:36,793
...he could be alive.

280
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:41,674
There is no chance of that.

281
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:44,200
And I'm telling you...

282
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:46,635
...there is.

He wrote every day.

286
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:04,755
Those letters could have
vital clues in them.

00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:10,755

289
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:12,280
That's not true.

290
00:25:13,560 --> 00:25:14,994
He didn't leave you with nothing.

291
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:19,273

from a bank account that he controls.

- Well, we'll wait for that, then.

Otherwise I will call the police
and they can sort this out.

- ...that you're at risk ofjail time...

- ...and your son could end up in care.

Yes. I will.

- I made sure that he...
- Yes. I remember your reassurances,

but Iofur gave him
the freedom to experiment all he wished.

457
00:37:49,640 --> 00:37:53,031
He had his own custom-built laboratory.

than you thought.

00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:33,560
You are important to us, Mr Scoresby.

542
00:43:35,160 --> 00:43:36,913
But I failed you.

543
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:38,918
And her.

544
00:43:39,040 --> 00:43:40,679
I lost Lyra.

545
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:42,951
You didn't fail me in the slightest.

546
00:43:43,080 --> 00:43:44,514
Or her.

547
00:43:44,640 --> 00:43:46,233
You fought for her.

548
00:43:46,360 --> 00:43:48,670
And now her fate is in another's hands.

549
00:43:49,800 --> 00:43:51,154
She's alive?

550
00:43:52,240 --> 00:43:53,913
And Roger? And Iorek?

551
00:43:54,040 --> 00:43:57,920
Kaisa brings word
that they all live and all thrive.

552
00:43:58,040 --> 00:44:01,556
Iorek, with Lyra's help,
has reclaimed his throne.

553
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:03,080
Yes!

554
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:04,759
She is...

555
00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:07,634
Well, isn't that something? Wow!

556
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:10,712
SERAFINA: I believe this is yours.

557
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:14,154
Where did you...?

558
00:44:15,520 --> 00:44:16,749
How did...?

559
00:44:17,960 --> 00:44:19,076
Oh.

560
00:44:20,320 --> 00:44:22,630
Oh, this means you need me to fight again,
doesn't it?

561
00:44:24,880 --> 00:44:28,430
The battles are just beginning.
The great war is coming soon.

562
00:44:28,560 --> 00:44:29,994
No-No more fancy talk.

563
00:44:30,120 --> 00:44:33,033
I'm just a hustler. I've played my part.

564
00:44:34,720 --> 00:44:38,031
I was useful for a piece,
but I'm no use to you now.

565
00:44:39,520 --> 00:44:40,920
You're wrong.

566
00:44:41,040 --> 00:44:43,475
And it's Lyra who will need you.

567
00:44:44,560 --> 00:44:46,552
So this is still about fate?

568
00:44:46,680 --> 00:44:48,034
Of course it is.

569
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:50,920
She needs me?

570
00:44:52,200 --> 00:44:54,112
She needs all of us.

571
00:44:55,520 --> 00:44:57,159
Then I hope I'm strong enough.

573
00:46:31,640 --> 00:46:34,314
There. Can you see?

574
00:46:35,920 --> 00:46:37,593
LYRA: That's where my father is?

575
00:46:39,080 --> 00:46:40,719
Why does he want to be here?

576
00:46:40,840 --> 00:46:43,309
That... you will have to ask your father.

If you need me, I will be close.

I will stand down the bears
that are keeping your father prisoner.

Both of you.

596
00:51:04,640 --> 00:51:07,997
You all right, Lyra?
Last time we saw him, he was your uncle.

597
00:51:11,760 --> 00:51:14,719
We're just giving him his alethiometer.

598
00:51:14,840 --> 00:51:17,275
And then maybe we can... go home.

599

- This for me or for you?
- Bit of both.

I know you're brave,

601

but hopefully you know
that if you are ever scared...

602
00:51:36,200 --> 00:51:37,200
...I'm here.

603
00:51:38,920 --> 00:51:40,513
I do.
