Beep-beep!

181
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:34,912
Your mum's mental, Parry.

182
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:38,034
Oi! Break!

183
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:39,514
Oi, break!

184
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:41,632
Don't...! I said get up.

185
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:43,240
Break!

186
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:46,637
What the hell was that? The both of you!

187
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:49,229
- He fouled me first.
- Towel off!

188
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:50,840
We're done today.

189
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:52,950
Go after her.

190
00:13:58,160 --> 00:13:59,719
Mum, Mum, Mum.

191
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:01,752
I'm sorry. I am sorry.

192
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:03,951
That was wrong.
I know you don't like that.

193
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:05,639
I didn't want to come, but I had to.

194
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:06,910
Come back inside, Mum.

195
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:09,496
I was going to the shop to get eggs,
and they were following...

196
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:11,477
- They weren't following you.
- There was a man

197
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:13,876
and he was asking about your dad.

198
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,150
Sure.

199
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:20,518
WILL: What are we doing now?

200
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:22,080
(UNDER BREATH)...eight, nine, ten...

201
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:24,231
WILL: Come back inside, Mum.
I need to get my stuff.

202
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:25,510
Mum?

203
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:27,393
- I'm just...
- Mum? Mum. Mum.

204
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:30,399
Hey. Come back inside.

205
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:32,034
Yeah?

206
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:35,399
OK.

207
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:49,875
Will.

208
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:54,040
Is she OK?

209
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:56,914
She's just having a bad spell
at the moment.

210
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:58,713
They pass.

211
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:00,194
Look, I know what people think...

212
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:02,357
Your mum needs you
to not care what people think.

213
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:06,914
But if she needs care, Will, proper care,
or if <i>you</i> need proper care...

214
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:10,112
She's just a bit unsettled.
We're not at risk.

215
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:13,838
Well, my door's always open.

216
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:17,351
- I know things aren't...
- We're fine.

217
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:22,600
I hope that's right.

218
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:33,960
Come on, Mum.

219
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:36,760
Let's get you home.

220

MA COSTA: You'll give yourself
a headache, staring like that.

221
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:53,870
I'm looking for my father.

222
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,550
Maybe once we save Roger,
we can go save my father too.

223
00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:00,752
KAISA: She is wise
to look for him up there.

224
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:04,556
Kaisa, is he right?
Is there a city in the lights?

225
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:06,353
KAISA: He believes so,

226
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:10,952
and the Magisterium thinks
he intends to use Dust in some way

227
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:13,914
in order to make a bridge
between this world

228
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:16,635
and the world beyond the aurora.

229
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:18,274
Is that why they imprisoned him?

230
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:22,599
At the Magisterium's behest,
the bears are keeping him captive.

231
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:25,474
But King Iofur is scheming
and duplicitous

232
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:30,391
and allows your father to continue
his research under house arrest.

233
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:35,072
Do you know what I'm looking for
in this fishing settlement?

234
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:39,114
No, but I know
you're right to look into it.

235
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:42,756
You must trust your instincts, Lyra.

236
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:52,314
Where are they going, do you think?

237
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:55,558
Your guess is as good as mine
on that one.

238
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:58,479
You'd better talk to John Faa
in the morning.

You haven't changed

You don't look so different.

243

Coram, I am 300 years or more.

245
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:47,073
You aren't so old
I can't see the man inside.

246
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:53,918
I didn't know you'd want to see me.

247
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:55,440
I didn't want to see you.

248
00:17:56,960 --> 00:18:00,317
- You went to our Consul. You started...
- I had no choice.

249
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:02,557
We need your help, Serafina.

250
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:04,000
Look at us.

251
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:09,355
We are walking into a battle
poorly manned and prepared for.

252
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:13,070
They will be ready for us.

253
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:14,953
But you will fight them anyway.

254
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:17,072
They are stealing our children.

255
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:20,590
You've found your fight
since last I saw you.

256
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:25,829
Our son was taken by disease.

257
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:30,193
These are being taken
by other human beings

258
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:32,232
and they must be stopped.

259
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:36,593
And even if I am too weak to fight them,

260
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:39,360
I am duty-bound to try!

261
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:44,398
The Magisterium?

262
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:47,638
Yes. While it may be madness
to confront them,

263
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:49,717
we cannot stand by.

264
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:53,993
That said, Asriel cannot claim sanity.

265
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:56,840
He looks for multiple worlds

266
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:59,520
when he should concentrate on this one.

267
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:02,280
He is right to search.

268
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:04,470
He is?

269
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:08,310
Witches have known of the other worlds
for thousands of years.

270
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:10,671
We are as close as a heartbeat...

271

272

...or see...

...or hear these other worlds...

...except in the northern lights.

275
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:23,119
And why there?

276
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:28,031
Because the charged particles in the
aurora make the matter of this world thin.

277
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:30,720
It is a time
when anything can happen.

Not <i>him.</i>

281
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:45,080
I must leave now. I have much to discuss

282
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:47,271
- with my sister witches.
- Will I see you again?

283
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:03,951
Kaisa will continue to lead you there.

There has never been a moment...
