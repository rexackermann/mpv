...I felt numb

4
00:00:23,420 --> 00:00:26,060
and so cold.

No, Lyra. We won't do that.

11
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:45,540
But, Will, once we've found your father,
we must leave this world.

12

Let's hope we find him fast.

13

Can't she?

28

She thinks you're the bravest fighter

38
00:04:54,660 --> 00:04:56,940
Not that I've had many friends.

39

You're her best friend, too.

that's where to look for them.

Serafina wants to scout ahead. She wants
to know exactly where these Spectres are.

79
00:10:06,060 --> 00:10:09,460
She's sending Lena down to the city
and Reina out to the forest.

80

- If we can track their movements...
- Spectres only affect adults.

That I'd take up his mantle,

87
00:10:31,540 --> 00:10:34,460
carry on whatever he went into
the other worlds to do.

88
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:37,740
I think that's why the alethiometer's
telling us to find him.

- It's connecting us.
- We can help him, Lyra.

And I let that best friend down.

95
00:11:12,060 --> 00:11:16,060
- Maybe this is how I let you down.
- You haven't let me down.

361
00:36:09,540 --> 00:36:13,140
I don't want to. I hate it. I don't want
anything to do with any of this.

362
00:36:13,180 --> 00:36:14,740
You're the Knife Bearer, Will.

363
00:36:15,900 --> 00:36:19,380
If you don't use it against them,
they'll tear it out of your hands

364
00:36:19,420 --> 00:36:23,060
and they'll destroy us.
They'll have absolute power.

365
00:36:24,740 --> 00:36:26,540
I'm sorry, Will, but...

366
00:36:26,580 --> 00:36:29,420
...you must do this. You must do it.

367
00:36:32,980 --> 00:36:34,780
And then we go home?

368
00:36:45,660 --> 00:36:47,340
Then we'll go home.

369
00:36:48,580 --> 00:36:50,620
All right? Then we'll go home.

370
00:36:55,380 --> 00:36:57,060
I can't. I'm not capable.

371
00:36:57,100 --> 00:36:58,820
- You fought for the Knife?
- Yes.

372
00:36:58,860 --> 00:37:00,380
Yes. It chose you.

373
00:37:00,420 --> 00:37:02,820
It chose you. Argue with anything else,

374
00:37:02,860 --> 00:37:05,660
but don't argue with your true nature.

375
00:37:06,700 --> 00:37:08,820
I'm not strong enough.

376
00:37:17,980 --> 00:37:19,740
Both of us were brought here.

377
00:37:21,780 --> 00:37:23,060
Do you understand?

378
00:37:24,820 --> 00:37:27,940
You with the Knife, and me to tell you
what to do with it, Will.

379
00:37:27,980 --> 00:37:30,100
Will. Will? Listen to me. This...

380
00:37:30,140 --> 00:37:33,460
- This is your duty.
- And your duty was to be my father.

381
00:37:33,500 --> 00:37:34,900
Will...

382
00:37:37,540 --> 00:37:39,420
...I'm so sorry.

383
00:37:39,460 --> 00:37:41,420
But look what you've become...

384
00:37:42,580 --> 00:37:44,100
...without me.

385
00:37:44,140 --> 00:37:46,460
You're a warrior, Will.

386
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:50,900
You're a warrior.

387
00:37:50,940 --> 00:37:51,980
Jopari!

388
00:37:54,540 --> 00:37:56,540
(GUNSHOT)

389
00:38:03,140 --> 00:38:05,620
(SCREECHING)

390
00:38:09,940 --> 00:38:11,300
Dad?

391
00:38:14,740 --> 00:38:16,340
Let me look at you.

392
00:38:19,260 --> 00:38:21,340
The night is full of angels.

393
00:38:21,380 --> 00:38:24,060
They will guide you now.

394
00:38:36,420 --> 00:38:37,980
Please.

395
00:39:25,900 --> 00:39:28,460
(PRAYS UNDER HER BREATH)

396
00:40:21,500 --> 00:40:24,460
LORD ASRIEL: <i>I have struggled
through many worlds to arrive here.</i>

397
00:40:27,100 --> 00:40:28,620
<i>But you know this.</i>

398
00:40:31,460 --> 00:40:33,260
<i>I have sacrificed things...</i>

399
00:40:35,860 --> 00:40:37,540
<i>...things I did not want to.</i>

400
00:40:42,580 --> 00:40:44,020
<i>My fight is not with you.</i>

401
00:40:49,140 --> 00:40:52,660
<i>But you are the last obstacle
between me and my enemy.</i>

402
00:40:53,860 --> 00:40:57,220
<i>And if I must, I will raise arms... again.</i>

403
00:40:58,740 --> 00:41:00,260
<i>My fight is with the Authority...</i>

404
00:41:01,460 --> 00:41:04,300
<i>...and those doling out cruelties
in his name...</i>

405
00:41:06,460 --> 00:41:11,020
<i>...those who seek to divide
in order to control...</i>

406
00:41:12,300 --> 00:41:17,340
<i>...and who have built worlds
founded on privilege and divine right</i>

407
00:41:17,380 --> 00:41:20,660
<i>rather than care and need.</i>

408
00:41:20,700 --> 00:41:24,020
<i>I fight for freedom of knowledge,</i>

409
00:41:24,060 --> 00:41:27,700
<i>and in place of deceit, intolerance
and prejudice...</i>

410
00:41:29,700 --> 00:41:34,300
<i>...I fight for the possibilities
of understanding, truth and acceptance.</i>

411
00:41:37,660 --> 00:41:41,260
<i>But I cannot win these things alone.</i>

412
00:41:44,740 --> 00:41:47,900
<i>I will need help and support.</i>

413
00:41:51,940 --> 00:41:54,180
<i>From you,</i>

414
00:41:54,220 --> 00:41:56,980
<i>and all those who have rebelled.</i>

415
00:42:00,140 --> 00:42:05,860
Let us be united in heart, soul and deed,

416
00:42:05,900 --> 00:42:09,940
and together we could build
a Republic of Heaven above

417
00:42:09,980 --> 00:42:12,820
and a Republic of Ideas below.

418
00:42:14,060 --> 00:42:17,860
Worlds in which the scars of history
may be healed.

419
00:42:18,860 --> 00:42:20,420
Better worlds,

420
00:42:20,460 --> 00:42:25,380
where the privilege of freedom
becomes the right of all peoples.

421
00:42:28,300 --> 00:42:29,940
But I tell you this now.

422
00:42:31,820 --> 00:42:33,580
There is no neutral ground.

423
00:42:33,620 --> 00:42:38,140
You are either for me
or you are against me.

424
00:42:38,180 --> 00:42:39,980
Now, which is it?

425
00:42:43,620 --> 00:42:45,500
(QUIETLY) You're out there.
I know you are.

426
00:42:47,020 --> 00:42:48,380
Answer me!

427
00:42:49,580 --> 00:42:51,900
(SHOUTING) Answer me!

428
00:43:02,060 --> 00:43:03,260
Asriel!

429
00:43:13,780 --> 00:43:18,460
ANGEL: We stand with you, Asriel Belacqua.

430
00:43:18,500 --> 00:43:20,180
Good.

431
00:43:20,220 --> 00:43:21,820
Then let us prepare for war.

432
00:43:52,740 --> 00:43:54,740
My darling Lyra.

433
00:43:57,340 --> 00:43:58,500
You're fine now.

434
00:43:59,660 --> 00:44:01,100
We're out of danger.

435
00:44:03,860 --> 00:44:06,380
I'm taking you somewhere entirely safe.

436
00:45:34,900 --> 00:45:36,340
BOY: <i>Lyra.</i>

437
00:45:38,500 --> 00:45:39,700
<i>Lyra!</i>

438
00:45:42,780 --> 00:45:43,940
<i>Lyra, help me!</i>

439
00:45:45,980 --> 00:45:47,380
LYRA: <i>Roger?</i>

440
00:45:49,180 --> 00:45:51,700
<i>What is this place?</i>
