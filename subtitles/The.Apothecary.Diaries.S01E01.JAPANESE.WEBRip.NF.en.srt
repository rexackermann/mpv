ORIGINAL STORY BY NATSU HYUUGA

2
00:01:32,091 --> 00:01:33,426
{\an8}THIS STORY IS A FICION, AND ALL NAMES OF
FIGURES ND ORGANIZATIONS ARE FICTITIOUS.

3
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:34,844
{\an8}MOREOVER, THE STORY HAS NO RELATION
TO REAL-LIFE INCIDENTS AND EVENTS.

4
00:01:38,890 --> 00:01:40,099
Maomao.

5
00:01:42,352 --> 00:01:45,563
Can you deliver medicine
to the Verdigris House?

6
00:01:46,606 --> 00:01:47,816
Got it, old man.

7
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:51,736
A lot of women are getting
kidnapped recently.

8
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:53,613
Be careful.

9
00:01:53,696 --> 00:01:55,281
I'll be fine.

10
00:01:55,365 --> 00:01:56,574
I'll stop by the farm.

11
00:01:57,158 --> 00:01:58,827
All right. Thank you.

12
00:01:59,536 --> 00:02:00,829
I'm off!

13
00:02:16,386 --> 00:02:18,805
THE VERDIGRIS HOUSE

14
00:02:24,853 --> 00:02:26,187
That's all you've got?

15
00:02:26,271 --> 00:02:28,857
Come on, this is my whole fortune!

16
00:02:32,986 --> 00:02:35,488
Out of the question.

17
00:02:35,572 --> 00:02:38,074
That's one of the Verdigris House's
prized Three Princesses,

18
00:02:38,158 --> 00:02:39,659
the popular Pairin!

19
00:02:39,742 --> 00:02:41,452
Don't look without paying!

20
00:02:51,087 --> 00:02:54,048
It's not healing fast enough.
I'll change the recipe.

21
00:02:54,132 --> 00:02:55,675
Oh, Maomao.

22
00:02:56,384 --> 00:02:57,927
Big Sis Pairin!

23
00:02:58,011 --> 00:02:59,971
Look at those new scars!

24
00:03:00,054 --> 00:03:01,431
Oh, this?

25
00:03:01,514 --> 00:03:03,558
They're experiments for my medicine,
like usual.

26
00:03:04,726 --> 00:03:06,352
Are you eating properly?

27
00:03:06,436 --> 00:03:09,063
Those things are impressive as always.

28
00:03:09,147 --> 00:03:12,150
Maomao! If one of your little experiments

29
00:03:12,233 --> 00:03:14,944
blows up this room, I won't forgive you!

30
00:03:17,447 --> 00:03:20,033
Or would you rather work
as a courtesan here instead?

31
00:03:20,617 --> 00:03:21,951
Shoot!

32
00:03:22,035 --> 00:03:23,786
Granny, I'm leaving the medicine here!

33
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:25,496
Say hello to the old man for me!

34
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:27,081
Geez.

35
00:03:27,165 --> 00:03:28,791
I heard Maomao's voice.

36
00:03:28,875 --> 00:03:32,003
-Where did Maomao go?
-She ran away.

37
00:03:32,086 --> 00:03:33,671
That sleazy granny...

38
00:03:33,755 --> 00:03:35,757
She tells me
to be a courtesan any chance she gets!

39
00:03:52,023 --> 00:03:53,483
<i>Could they be kidnappers?</i>

40
00:03:59,739 --> 00:04:02,700
Old man will worry about me.

41
00:04:20,009 --> 00:04:21,928
The Eastern Palace heir is born!

42
00:04:22,011 --> 00:04:24,013
Congratulations, Lady Lihua!

43
00:04:31,688 --> 00:04:34,607
Her baby was delivered without issues.

44
00:04:34,691 --> 00:04:36,609
I see. I'm glad...

45
00:04:41,698 --> 00:04:44,826
{\an8}THREE MONTHS LATER

46
00:04:49,914 --> 00:04:52,834
I want to eat skewers from the market...

47
00:04:53,835 --> 00:04:56,587
I hope the old man is eating properly.

48
00:04:58,256 --> 00:05:02,343
<i>So annoying. I don't know if I was
sold off or used as a scapegoat,</i>

49
00:05:02,427 --> 00:05:04,595
<i>but it's been three months
since I got here.</i>

50
00:05:05,346 --> 00:05:08,516
<i>The palace and the pleasure district
are not that different.</i>

51
00:05:08,599 --> 00:05:12,353
<i>I wanted to avoid getting involved
in the rear palace if possible, but...</i>

52
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:16,357
now that I'm here, it can't be helped.

53
00:05:17,066 --> 00:05:20,778
<i>Even though I had a pretty good life
as an apothecary...</i>

54
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:26,534
<i>The rear palace is an all-female area
for giving birth to the emperor's child.</i>

55
00:05:26,617 --> 00:05:29,287
<i>Men are strictly forbidden
from entering this area.</i>

56
00:05:29,996 --> 00:05:34,167
<i>The only people who can enter here are
high nobility and their blood relations.</i>

57
00:05:34,751 --> 00:05:37,211
<i>Other than that, only eunuchs,
or "former men"</i>

58
00:05:37,295 --> 00:05:39,797
<i>who've lost their "precious parts"
can enter.</i>

59
00:05:40,590 --> 00:05:43,676
<i>All the consorts
and palace women total 2,000.</i>

60
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:46,262
<i>Along with the 1,000 eunuchs,
it is a large living area.</i>

61
00:05:46,804 --> 00:05:50,308
<i>Unlike the high, mid
and low-ranking consorts,</i>

62
00:05:50,391 --> 00:05:53,144
<i>us maidservants doing menial tasks</i>

63
00:05:53,227 --> 00:05:55,313
<i>can lose our lives at any moment.</i>

64
00:05:55,396 --> 00:05:57,106
SEVENTEEN

65
00:05:57,190 --> 00:06:00,068
<i>Next up is the shut-in
low-ranking consort.</i>

66
00:06:00,151 --> 00:06:03,488
<i>At least we get paid a salary.</i>

67
00:06:03,571 --> 00:06:05,740
Hey, Maomao!

68
00:06:05,823 --> 00:06:08,326
Do you know which room this tag is for?

69
00:06:09,327 --> 00:06:12,371
This is Wisteria Nine, so it's over there.

70
00:06:12,955 --> 00:06:14,624
Thank you!

71
00:06:15,249 --> 00:06:17,794
<i>There are many maidservants
who can't read.</i>

72
00:06:18,669 --> 00:06:20,171
<i>Before working at the rear palace,</i>

73
00:06:20,254 --> 00:06:22,298
<i>we are trained strictly in basic manners,</i>

74
00:06:23,132 --> 00:06:26,385
<i>but it's different
with reading and writing.</i>

75
00:06:26,469 --> 00:06:29,263
<i>Even if you got higher salaries
for your literacy,</i>

76
00:06:29,347 --> 00:06:32,558
<i>the kidnappers would just take
a higher portion of your pay.</i>

77
00:06:33,684 --> 00:06:35,353
<i>But there are rare cases</i>

78
00:06:35,436 --> 00:06:37,522
<i>where maidservants are promoted to
low-ranking consorts.</i>

79
00:06:37,605 --> 00:06:38,564
<i>Simply put...</i>

80
00:06:41,192 --> 00:06:42,318
<i>it's looks.</i>

81
00:06:42,401 --> 00:06:44,821
<i>Freckles, flat chest.</i>

82
00:06:45,446 --> 00:06:46,781
<i>A figure with no curves.</i>

83
00:06:46,864 --> 00:06:49,200
<i>So it has nothing to do with me.</i>

84
00:06:54,247 --> 00:06:57,750
<i>If I stand out too much,
my life could be put at risk.</i>

85
00:06:57,834 --> 00:06:59,085
<i>I'd rather stay like this.</i>

86
00:07:00,461 --> 00:07:03,673
<i>If I shut up and work,
I can leave after two years.</i>

87
00:07:05,508 --> 00:07:07,760
<i>I want to drink so bad!</i>

88
00:07:10,346 --> 00:07:12,140
-Hey, did you hear?
-Huh?

89
00:07:12,223 --> 00:07:16,144
There's apparently a really pretty
eunuch in the central area.

90
00:07:16,227 --> 00:07:19,564
That's all everyone's talking about
these days!

91
00:07:19,647 --> 00:07:21,107
I see.

92
00:07:21,190 --> 00:07:25,111
If he's that beautiful,
I'd love to see him once, don't you think?

93
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:28,197
A eunuch, huh?

94
00:07:56,350 --> 00:07:59,604
-She's lost a lot of weight.
-Yeah.

95
00:08:05,985 --> 00:08:07,278
Xiaoling...

96
00:08:07,361 --> 00:08:09,739
Unfortunately,

97
00:08:09,822 --> 00:08:12,825
the physician is fully occupied
with the Eastern Palace.

98
00:08:14,911 --> 00:08:16,454
I see.

99
00:08:18,039 --> 00:08:20,708
They're just three months
and six months old, right?

100
00:08:20,791 --> 00:08:24,712
Yes, both the Eastern Palace
and Princess Lingli.

101
00:08:24,795 --> 00:08:27,048
Do you think it's a curse, like they say?

102
00:08:28,382 --> 00:08:29,300
What's this about?

103
00:08:29,383 --> 00:08:31,844
You don't know, Maomao?

104
00:08:31,928 --> 00:08:35,765
The entire rear palace is
talking about this!

105
00:08:35,848 --> 00:08:39,310
About the serial deaths of the heirs
in the rear palace!

106
00:08:39,393 --> 00:08:42,063
<i>All three of the Emperor's children got</i>

107
00:08:42,146 --> 00:08:45,066
<i>gradually weaker after their births
and died!</i>

108
00:08:45,149 --> 00:08:46,692
<i>It's strange, right?</i>

109
00:08:46,776 --> 00:08:48,027
<i>All three babies?</i>

110
00:08:48,110 --> 00:08:50,446
<i>It looks like the same thing
is happening now.</i>

111
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:51,697
<i>The baby is sick?</i>

112
00:08:51,781 --> 00:08:55,493
Exactly! So this time, there are doctors
in both Lady Gyokuyou

113
00:08:55,576 --> 00:08:58,829
and Lady Lihua's residences!

114
00:09:00,623 --> 00:09:03,167
The current emperor has no empress,

115
00:09:03,251 --> 00:09:06,254
so Lady Lihua, who gave birth to
the Eastern Palace will be empress!

116
00:09:07,046 --> 00:09:08,881
That's obvious.

117
00:09:08,965 --> 00:09:12,969
<i>If the emperor has no empress,
the consort with the Eastern Palace,</i>

118
00:09:13,052 --> 00:09:15,471
<i>Consort Lihua,
is at the top of the rear palace.</i>

119
00:09:15,555 --> 00:09:18,266
<i>But it's rumored that
the emperor's favorite</i>

120
00:09:18,349 --> 00:09:20,560
<i>is Lady Gyokuyou.</i>

121
00:09:20,643 --> 00:09:24,397
<i>People say that might have something
to do with all this.</i>

122
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:26,983
A political power struggle, huh?

123
00:09:27,567 --> 00:09:30,903
I wonder if Lady Lihua's condition
is more serious.

124
00:09:30,987 --> 00:09:33,698
I hear the doctor is by her side
day and night.

125
00:09:33,781 --> 00:09:35,366
Lady Lihua is unwell as well?

126
00:09:35,449 --> 00:09:37,076
Yes. Both mother and child.

127
00:09:37,159 --> 00:09:41,247
I heard they have headaches,
stomachaches, and nausea as well.

128
00:09:42,373 --> 00:09:46,043
Headaches, stomachaches, and nausea...

129
00:09:46,127 --> 00:09:49,463
I knew it! It's definitely a curse!

130
00:09:51,048 --> 00:09:54,844
-A curse? You've got to be joking.
-What?

131
00:09:59,181 --> 00:10:02,268
Headaches, stomachaches, and nausea...

132
00:10:02,351 --> 00:10:04,645
Could murder by poison be a possibility?

133
00:10:04,729 --> 00:10:09,066
No. If they want the throne, there's
no reason for the princess to be targeted.

134
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:11,986
It's highly unlikely they were poisoned.

135
00:10:12,069 --> 00:10:14,530
It could be an illness, or...

136
00:10:15,656 --> 00:10:18,075
Could it be in their blood?

137
00:10:19,535 --> 00:10:23,456
Why am I getting so serious over rumors?

138
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:27,043
These are just speculations.

139
00:10:27,668 --> 00:10:29,837
Just speculation. However...

140
00:10:30,755 --> 00:10:33,215
I can check it out for a little bit.

141
00:10:37,678 --> 00:10:40,931
As expected of a building
where the high-ranking consorts live,

142
00:10:41,015 --> 00:10:43,893
even a single pillar is more sophisticated

143
00:10:43,976 --> 00:10:46,187
than the building we live in.

144
00:10:48,606 --> 00:10:49,815
It's your fault!

145
00:10:49,899 --> 00:10:51,275
Lady Gyokuyou!

146
00:10:51,901 --> 00:10:53,736
Because you gave birth to a girl,

147
00:10:53,819 --> 00:10:55,905
you intend to curse my son to death!

148
00:10:55,988 --> 00:10:59,367
You know that that's impossible.

149
00:10:59,450 --> 00:11:02,036
Xiaoling is suffering
just as much as your son.

150
00:11:02,745 --> 00:11:05,164
Lady Lihua is furious.

151
00:11:05,247 --> 00:11:07,124
How unfortunate for Lady Gyokuyou.

152
00:11:07,208 --> 00:11:08,793
Sir Jinshi...

153
00:11:11,504 --> 00:11:15,341
That's why I want you
to examine my daughter as well.

154
00:11:15,424 --> 00:11:17,593
Yes, but... Well...

155
00:11:17,676 --> 00:11:21,597
<i>Is that flustered eunuch
in the middle, the physician?</i>

156
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:23,182
<i>That quack doctor, is he stupid?</i>

157
00:11:23,265 --> 00:11:27,686
<i>He spends all that time with the two
consorts, and he really hasn't realized?</i>

158
00:11:28,354 --> 00:11:31,440
<i>Or... could it be, he doesn't even know?</i>

159
00:11:32,233 --> 00:11:36,320
<i>Deaths of infants. Headache,
stomachache, and nausea.</i>

160
00:11:36,404 --> 00:11:40,449
<i>And even more, the haggard state
of Lady Lihua.</i>

161
00:11:40,533 --> 00:11:43,702
<i>This isn't a curse at all.</i>

162
00:11:44,328 --> 00:11:45,996
<i>The problem is how to tell them.</i>

163
00:11:47,248 --> 00:11:49,291
If I can find something to write with...

164
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:35,880
<i>Not a month had passed when the news about</i>

165
00:12:35,963 --> 00:12:38,924
<i>the Eastern Palace's death got around.</i>

166
00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:45,556
<i>It looks like you want to
ask me something.</i>

167
00:12:46,348 --> 00:12:47,516
This is...

168
00:12:48,309 --> 00:12:50,478
It was the day I visited
the Crystal Pavilion

169
00:12:50,561 --> 00:12:53,272
to ask for my daughter to be examined.

170
00:12:53,772 --> 00:12:56,567
This was placed by my window after that.

171
00:12:56,650 --> 00:12:58,152
It was tied to this branch.

172
00:12:59,195 --> 00:13:01,030
A rhododendron?

173
00:13:02,156 --> 00:13:05,493
"The powder is poison.
Don't let the baby touch it.

174
00:13:06,827 --> 00:13:08,621
Ignorance is sin."

175
00:13:09,455 --> 00:13:13,834
A court physician wouldn't leave
such a cryptic message.

176
00:13:13,918 --> 00:13:18,714
Yes, it looks like he never figured out
how to treat the Eastern Palace.

177
00:13:18,797 --> 00:13:20,883
Who wrote this letter?

178
00:13:21,759 --> 00:13:24,178
I want you to find that out for me.

179
00:13:28,474 --> 00:13:30,392
<i>Now that I think about it, that time...</i>

180
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:34,605
If I can find something to write with...

181
00:13:38,776 --> 00:13:39,902
Understood.

182
00:13:40,444 --> 00:13:43,572
Could I keep this with me
for a little while?

183
00:13:49,495 --> 00:13:52,915
The Emperor is cherishing
the princess who survived,

184
00:13:52,998 --> 00:13:55,334
so he's been visiting Lady Gyokuyou often.

185
00:13:55,918 --> 00:13:57,670
What about Lady Lihua?

186
00:13:57,753 --> 00:14:00,297
I don't hear about that at all.

187
00:14:00,381 --> 00:14:02,550
How convenient for him, huh?

188
00:14:02,633 --> 00:14:05,052
Oh, I finally found you!

189
00:14:05,135 --> 00:14:08,597
You're to head to the Matron of
the Serving Women's office right away.

190
00:14:08,681 --> 00:14:09,682
What?

191
00:14:09,765 --> 00:14:11,350
You've been summoned?

192
00:14:11,433 --> 00:14:13,102
I wonder what this is about.

193
00:14:14,144 --> 00:14:17,856
All right, everybody who gathered here
should enter.

194
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:21,235
<i>Maidservants being
summoned by a higher-up?</i>

195
00:14:21,318 --> 00:14:23,571
<i>I have a bad feeling about this.</i>

196
00:14:24,655 --> 00:14:26,198
<i>Are they just short on staff?</i>

197
00:14:37,751 --> 00:14:40,421
Sorry to call you all like this.

198
00:14:45,009 --> 00:14:47,678
<i>Who is this bossy palace woman?</i>

199
00:14:50,431 --> 00:14:53,642
I'm the manager of the rear palace,
Jinshi.

200
00:14:58,272 --> 00:15:00,024
<i>He's a man?</i>

201
00:15:00,107 --> 00:15:05,821
<i>I guess the "really pretty eunuch"
Xiaolan mentioned was this guy.</i>

202
00:15:05,905 --> 00:15:07,990
<i>What a waste for him</i>

203
00:15:08,073 --> 00:15:10,826
<i>to be this beautiful
and not be able to have children.</i>

204
00:15:13,495 --> 00:15:14,496
{\an8}THE FRECKLE WOMAN OVER THERE,
YOU'RE STAYING WITH ME.

205
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:16,832
{\an8}<i>Freckle... Woman...</i>

206
00:15:17,833 --> 00:15:19,335
<i>Oh, shit!</i>

207
00:15:21,253 --> 00:15:24,673
We're done for today.
Go back to your rooms.

208
00:15:24,757 --> 00:15:26,592
Huh? What's going on?

209
00:15:26,675 --> 00:15:30,137
<i>Did I make some big mistake
that got his attention?</i>

210
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:32,723
<i>Could it be the letter from that time...</i>

211
00:15:33,557 --> 00:15:37,353
<i>I see! I'm the only maidservant here
that can read.</i>

212
00:15:37,436 --> 00:15:40,689
<i>He wrote that sentence to figure that out!</i>

213
00:15:40,773 --> 00:15:42,441
<i>Shit, I have to run...</i>

214
00:15:42,524 --> 00:15:46,904
You can't run. I told you, you're staying.

215
00:15:47,738 --> 00:15:49,281
Shut up and come with me.

216
00:15:55,245 --> 00:15:56,956
<i>I got played...</i>

217
00:15:57,539 --> 00:15:58,624
This is strange.

218
00:15:58,707 --> 00:16:03,295
I looked at my records
and it said you can't read.

219
00:16:03,379 --> 00:16:06,090
Yes, I was born of low class.

220
00:16:06,173 --> 00:16:08,342
This must be some sort of mistake.

221
00:16:09,134 --> 00:16:10,886
<i>Why would I tell you?</i>

222
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:14,348
<i>The world is easier to get around
if you pretend to know nothing.</i>

223
00:16:14,431 --> 00:16:18,852
<i>Anyways, how did this man find out
about my letter?</i>

224
00:16:18,936 --> 00:16:21,605
<i>I was careful of my surroundings!</i>

225
00:16:25,275 --> 00:16:27,069
<i>Why is he so suspicious?</i>

226
00:16:28,445 --> 00:16:30,906
<i>He has way too much time on his hands!</i>

227
00:16:32,032 --> 00:16:34,034
-Come in.
-Excuse me.

228
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:37,162
<i>What will they yell at me for?</i>

229
00:16:37,246 --> 00:16:39,206
<i>I hope I can make it out alive...</i>

230
00:16:43,544 --> 00:16:45,838
I have come with the girl.

231
00:16:45,921 --> 00:16:46,964
Come in.

232
00:16:52,219 --> 00:16:53,846
I'm sorry for the trouble.

233
00:16:58,851 --> 00:16:59,893
I'm so glad...

234
00:17:01,395 --> 00:17:02,896
So you are...

235
00:17:03,522 --> 00:17:06,233
You've saved my Lingli's life.

236
00:17:06,316 --> 00:17:07,901
Thank you.

237
00:17:07,985 --> 00:17:11,405
I'm not of a position
for you to do such things!

238
00:17:12,406 --> 00:17:16,035
No. I can't thank you enough.

239
00:17:16,618 --> 00:17:18,912
My child owes you her life.

240
00:17:18,996 --> 00:17:21,749
You're mistaking me for someone else.

241
00:17:21,832 --> 00:17:24,001
You've probably made a mistake.

242
00:17:24,626 --> 00:17:26,879
<i>I'd hate to get beheaded
for contradicting her,</i>

243
00:17:26,962 --> 00:17:28,964
<i>but I don't want to get involved!</i>

244
00:17:32,634 --> 00:17:36,055
I have something from Consort Gyokuyou.

245
00:17:38,682 --> 00:17:43,103
{\an8}You know that this fabric is used
in the uniform of maidservants, right?

246
00:17:43,687 --> 00:17:46,148
{\an8}I guess it looks similar...

247
00:17:46,231 --> 00:17:50,110
{\an8}Yes, it's used by maidservants
in Wardrobe Service.

248
00:17:50,194 --> 00:17:54,031
{\an8}For example, a laundry girl like you...

249
00:17:54,114 --> 00:17:57,785
Maybe you ripped off a hem
from your skirt.

250
00:18:00,704 --> 00:18:02,915
<i>He even knew about that?</i>

251
00:18:03,582 --> 00:18:05,375
Tell us.

252
00:18:05,459 --> 00:18:08,420
Why did you place a rhododendron branch
by the window?

253
00:18:19,181 --> 00:18:22,601
Because I found out about
the truth behind the incidents.

254
00:18:22,684 --> 00:18:24,269
It was caused by the face powder.

255
00:18:25,854 --> 00:18:28,065
<i>In the pleasure district where I grew up,</i>

256
00:18:28,148 --> 00:18:31,276
<i>there were many courtesans
who used expensive powder.</i>

257
00:18:32,111 --> 00:18:33,695
Most of these women

258
00:18:33,779 --> 00:18:37,199
were consumed by the poison
contained in the powder

259
00:18:37,282 --> 00:18:38,575
and lost their lives.

260
00:18:40,953 --> 00:18:43,705
<i>They weighed their lives against beauty,</i>

261
00:18:43,789 --> 00:18:45,916
<i>and ended up losing both.</i>

262
00:18:54,591 --> 00:18:57,636
I was an apothecary,

263
00:18:58,345 --> 00:19:00,013
so I know a lot about poison.

264
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:10,190
That face powder...

265
00:19:10,274 --> 00:19:13,110
This was used by my child's wet nurse.

266
00:19:13,193 --> 00:19:15,904
She said the white of this powder
stood out the most,

267
00:19:15,988 --> 00:19:17,614
so she liked using this.

268
00:19:18,198 --> 00:19:21,952
The wet nurse was also ill,
so I placed her on leave.

269
00:19:22,035 --> 00:19:23,745
I gave her plenty of money as well.

270
00:19:24,872 --> 00:19:26,373
I see.

271
00:19:26,456 --> 00:19:29,001
Ignorance is sin.

272
00:19:29,084 --> 00:19:33,046
I should've kept a closer watch
on what my child puts in her mouth.

273
00:19:33,797 --> 00:19:35,465
I should have as well.

274
00:19:35,549 --> 00:19:37,759
If we had realized this earlier,

275
00:19:37,843 --> 00:19:41,889
we could've saved many lives.
Even the Eastern Palace...

276
00:19:43,473 --> 00:19:45,309
After finding this letter,

277
00:19:45,392 --> 00:19:48,937
I told Consort Lihua about
the powder as well, but...

278
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:55,944
<i>She wouldn't listen to anything
I had to say.</i>

279
00:19:57,571 --> 00:19:58,906
So...

280
00:20:00,032 --> 00:20:03,702
What should I do?

281
00:20:10,792 --> 00:20:13,879
Starting today, you will be my attendant!

282
00:20:15,339 --> 00:20:16,298
What?

283
00:20:17,758 --> 00:20:20,052
<i>What Maomao can't hold back</i>

284
00:20:20,135 --> 00:20:23,180
<i>is her curiosity and her appetite
for knowledge.</i>

285
00:20:23,263 --> 00:20:26,808
<i>That, and a little bit of
a sense of justice...</i>

286
00:20:32,105 --> 00:20:34,566
<i>Shit, shit, shit!</i>

287
00:20:34,650 --> 00:20:37,152
<i>If I had just stayed put and worked.</i>

288
00:20:37,236 --> 00:20:39,279
<i>-I could've...</i>
-Welcome back, Maomao!

289
00:20:39,363 --> 00:20:40,781
How did it go?

290
00:20:40,864 --> 00:20:45,577
<i>This is how Maomao became
the lady-in-waiting for</i>

291
00:20:45,661 --> 00:20:47,913
<i>the Emperor's beloved Consort Gyokuyou.</i>

292
00:20:47,996 --> 00:20:51,083
<i>In other words, she got a promotion!</i>

293
00:20:51,625 --> 00:20:53,293
LI

294
00:20:59,758 --> 00:21:00,884
Hey!

295
00:21:02,511 --> 00:21:03,929
This is poison!
