1
00:00:30,613 --> 00:00:34,826
It's been a difficult month at CERN.
A half-dozen projects suspended.

2
00:00:34,909 --> 00:00:37,495
Dr. Schmidt seemed to take it quite hard.

3
00:00:41,082 --> 00:00:44,502
There must be 30 dead scientists
in the past couple months.

4
00:00:44,586 --> 00:00:45,879
Thirty-two.

5
00:00:46,463 --> 00:00:49,215
No sign of struggle or forced entry,

6
00:00:49,841 --> 00:00:52,427
but sort of an odd suicide, huh?

7
00:00:54,846 --> 00:00:57,766
Oppenheimer's mistress died the same way.

8
00:00:58,266 --> 00:01:00,185
On her knees, head in a tub.

9
00:01:01,227 --> 00:01:03,104
Some think she was murdered.

10
00:01:05,315 --> 00:01:09,152
Maybe she just knew the kind of misery
the world was about to face.

11
00:01:21,623 --> 00:01:23,833
Have a look at what he's locked away.

12
00:01:42,727 --> 00:01:44,604
Oh. Hello, darling.

13
00:01:46,064 --> 00:01:48,566
I've heard so much about you.

14
00:02:03,039 --> 00:02:05,291
On his knees,
with his head in the bathtub?

15
00:02:05,375 --> 00:02:06,918
That's what my buddy at CERN said.

16
00:02:07,001 --> 00:02:09,963
- How does that even work?
- You take a lot of pills first.

17
00:02:10,046 --> 00:02:12,173
It's not a good time
to be a theoretical physicist.

18
00:02:12,257 --> 00:02:13,716
Or applied physicist.

19
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,593
Or a cosmologist. Right?

20
00:02:15,677 --> 00:02:18,012
- Wasn't one of them a cosmologist?
- One of who?

21
00:02:18,096 --> 00:02:20,140
The scientists
who've been topping themselves.

22
00:02:20,223 --> 00:02:21,683
Hope it's not contagious.

23
00:02:23,309 --> 00:02:27,647
The numbers that you were seeing...
has that come back?

24
00:02:27,730 --> 00:02:29,190
No, it's gone.

25
00:02:29,941 --> 00:02:31,401
Along with my career.

26
00:02:37,615 --> 00:02:38,950
Vodka cran.

27
00:02:39,033 --> 00:02:41,119
Shifted half a million
of those last quarter.

28
00:02:44,122 --> 00:02:45,122
Is there a bathroom?

29
00:02:45,165 --> 00:02:48,585
Well, uh, take your pick,
but there's a Japanese toilet upstairs.

30
00:02:48,668 --> 00:02:49,502
Touchless.

31
00:02:49,586 --> 00:02:50,586
Thanks.

32
00:02:53,339 --> 00:02:55,300
Right. What else can I get you all?

33
00:02:56,342 --> 00:02:59,554
Uh... you got any more Cheddar Twirlies?

34
00:02:59,637 --> 00:03:00,930
Swirlies.

35
00:03:01,431 --> 00:03:02,557
Cheddar Swirlies.

36
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:05,393
Why don't I show you the full assortment,
in the garage?

37
00:03:05,476 --> 00:03:06,476
Cool.

38
00:03:25,496 --> 00:03:26,748
What are they saying?

39
00:03:27,248 --> 00:03:28,249
Probably nothing.

40
00:03:28,958 --> 00:03:30,835
Oh, it's definitely not nothing.

41
00:03:30,919 --> 00:03:33,296
Didn't you take
Animal Behavior with Rick Boyum?

42
00:03:33,379 --> 00:03:36,174
Please. I was too much
of a hard science snob.

43
00:03:36,966 --> 00:03:38,843
- Still am.
- Well, your loss.

44
00:03:38,927 --> 00:03:41,554
Boyum was the best teacher I ever had.

45
00:03:41,638 --> 00:03:42,680
Sorry, Vera.

46
00:03:44,599 --> 00:03:48,978
He used to say that all birdsong
boiled down to one of two things.

47
00:03:49,479 --> 00:03:51,689
It was either "me, me, me"
or "mate, mate, mate."

48
00:03:51,773 --> 00:03:55,068
Or maybe it was "mine, mine, mine"
or "mate, mate, mate."

49
00:03:55,151 --> 00:03:58,238
I can't remember,
but there was definitely mating involved.

50
00:04:00,323 --> 00:04:03,451
Just think, to some kid,
you're their Rick Boyum.

51
00:04:04,702 --> 00:04:07,538
But with physics, which,
let's face it, is way better.

52
00:04:10,833 --> 00:04:13,336
I'm quitting teaching, actually.

53
00:04:15,338 --> 00:04:16,339
What?

54
00:04:17,632 --> 00:04:18,632
Why?

55
00:04:20,468 --> 00:04:22,971
Maybe there's more to life
than knowing everything.

56
00:04:23,972 --> 00:04:26,224
Unlikely.

57
00:04:26,307 --> 00:04:28,685
Well, what about
watching these little fellas?

58
00:04:29,352 --> 00:04:31,020
I'm enjoying watching them.

59
00:04:31,104 --> 00:04:34,941
Do you really have to know what they're
doing to enjoy watching them do it?

60
00:04:35,024 --> 00:04:36,150
Yeah, I do.

61
00:04:38,486 --> 00:04:40,071
Let's all go birdwatching, then.

62
00:04:40,154 --> 00:04:42,031
We'll go to Patagonia or something.

63
00:04:42,657 --> 00:04:44,075
Somewhere fucking great.

64
00:04:44,158 --> 00:04:46,244
Jack can pay for everything.

65
00:04:46,327 --> 00:04:49,122
What do you think?
We can get the fuck out of England.

66
00:04:49,205 --> 00:04:51,249
Go and explore the ways of the birds.

67
00:04:53,293 --> 00:04:54,377
Someday.

68
00:04:58,047 --> 00:05:00,008
I've still got some things to do here.

69
00:05:14,731 --> 00:05:15,982
Holy shit.

70
00:05:19,068 --> 00:05:20,778
Oh, Jack.

71
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:27,577
<i>♪ A stranger's light comes on slowly ♪</i>

72
00:05:31,914 --> 00:05:36,377
<i>♪ A stranger's heart without a home ♪</i>

73
00:05:41,299 --> 00:05:45,261
<i>♪ You put your hands into your head ♪</i>

74
00:05:53,811 --> 00:05:55,146
Wait, what?

75
00:06:06,032 --> 00:06:07,450
You were not invited.

76
00:06:11,371 --> 00:06:12,830
- Jack!
- ...a few flavors out of it.

77
00:06:12,914 --> 00:06:14,082
Jack, what the fuck is this?

78
00:06:14,165 --> 00:06:17,585
- You're getting fingerprints all over it!
- A woman tried to cut my head off.

79
00:06:17,668 --> 00:06:18,836
What, you played?

80
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:20,713
I was in the fucking Middle Ages.

81
00:06:20,797 --> 00:06:22,256
Tudor England. It's not quite...

82
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:24,550
No. All my senses were telling me
that I was there.

83
00:06:24,634 --> 00:06:26,761
I could see a castle,
and I could feel the wind...

84
00:06:26,844 --> 00:06:28,596
You can smell the people.

85
00:06:28,679 --> 00:06:30,098
Do not smell Henry VIII.

86
00:06:30,181 --> 00:06:32,101
That's nothing compared
to the rehydrated people.

87
00:06:32,141 --> 00:06:34,227
I never thought
I could get bored of nudity.

88
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:35,353
You're playing this?

89
00:06:37,563 --> 00:06:39,357
Dr. Ye gave me Vera's.

90
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:42,235
Vera was playing this game
before she killed herself?

91
00:06:42,318 --> 00:06:43,945
And now you're playing it?

92
00:06:44,028 --> 00:06:46,428
The only thing that's gonna make people
wanna kill themselves

93
00:06:46,489 --> 00:06:49,826
is this annoying brat that's
constantly whining, "Oh, save me."

94
00:06:49,909 --> 00:06:53,371
- Because you're supposed to save her.
- No, you figure out how the sun moves.

95
00:06:53,454 --> 00:06:56,707
- She's there every time you play.
- What the fuck is wrong with you?

96
00:06:58,334 --> 00:07:00,378
We don't have this technology.

97
00:07:00,461 --> 00:07:01,921
Where did this come from?

98
00:07:02,004 --> 00:07:03,339
Hey, hey, hey! Whoa, whoa!

99
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:05,263
That thing
is hacking into your brain.

100
00:07:05,299 --> 00:07:08,428
You don't want an Alexa in your house,
and you're playing with that?

101
00:07:09,053 --> 00:07:11,639
- Don't! Don't put it on.
- I'm not gonna put it on.

102
00:07:11,722 --> 00:07:14,016
Sword Lady will just
cut your head off as well.

103
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:15,601
No invitation, no game.

104
00:07:15,685 --> 00:07:16,894
Who invited you?

105
00:07:18,771 --> 00:07:19,939
I don't know.

106
00:07:21,274 --> 00:07:24,318
I just came home one night,
and it was right there.

107
00:07:24,861 --> 00:07:27,530
What? So someone broke in
and left it here?

108
00:07:27,613 --> 00:07:30,616
And then you were like,
"Oh. I should put this on me head"?

109
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:33,077
I've got state-of-the-art security.

110
00:07:33,161 --> 00:07:36,330
I've been through every camera feed.
No sign of anyone coming in or out.

111
00:07:36,414 --> 00:07:38,291
Well, you don't think that's alarming?

112
00:07:38,374 --> 00:07:39,667
Scrubbed from the footage,

113
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:42,420
just like the woman who told me
the universe was gonna blink at me?

114
00:07:42,503 --> 00:07:45,214
You can't compare this
to unexplained cosmic phenomenon.

115
00:07:45,298 --> 00:07:46,591
It's just not the same thing.

116
00:07:46,674 --> 00:07:47,925
Except it kinda is.

117
00:07:48,968 --> 00:07:52,138
The stars, Auggie's countdown,
this video game...

118
00:07:52,972 --> 00:07:56,767
They're all virtual realities
indistinguishable from actual reality.

119
00:07:57,268 --> 00:08:00,271
Well, all right, then, boy genius.
Who's behind it?

120
00:08:00,855 --> 00:08:03,065
- It's not my field.
- Saul.

121
00:08:03,566 --> 00:08:05,943
Maybe think about it
for more than ten seconds?

122
00:08:10,072 --> 00:08:11,824
If it's a direct neural interface,

123
00:08:11,908 --> 00:08:14,452
it's controlling
all sensory inputs and outputs.

124
00:08:14,952 --> 00:08:17,552
Everything that goes into your brain
and everything that goes out.

125
00:08:18,623 --> 00:08:20,875
If it can exercise control at that level,

126
00:08:22,001 --> 00:08:23,628
Vera wasn't herself.

127
00:08:24,921 --> 00:08:26,631
She wasn't the person that I knew.

128
00:08:26,714 --> 00:08:31,135
Is it possible that... this thing
was manipulating her in some way?

129
00:08:32,887 --> 00:08:34,347
I wouldn't touch it.

130
00:08:34,430 --> 00:08:36,307
Okay, I'm not going to kill myself.

131
00:08:36,390 --> 00:08:38,893
I'm definitely not killing myself.
My life's amazing.

132
00:08:38,976 --> 00:08:41,020
Promise me you'll stop playing.

133
00:08:44,941 --> 00:08:45,983
Please.

134
00:08:51,155 --> 00:08:53,157
All right. Fine.

135
00:08:54,617 --> 00:08:55,660
We'll stop.

136
00:08:56,994 --> 00:08:59,080
The Sword Lady said
we're supposed to use science

137
00:08:59,163 --> 00:09:00,790
to save the next civilization, right?

138
00:09:00,873 --> 00:09:03,793
<i>So we need to come up with a way
to predict the next stable era</i>

139
00:09:03,876 --> 00:09:05,044
<i>and how long it'll last.</i>

140
00:09:09,090 --> 00:09:11,342
<i>Christ! How much have you been playing?</i>

141
00:09:13,719 --> 00:09:17,473
<i>Oh, fuck off, you spod.
You keep a whiteboard in your flat?</i>

142
00:09:17,557 --> 00:09:20,393
Yeah, that's my work.
You've got snacks at yours, don't you?

143
00:09:20,476 --> 00:09:22,353
<i>You can't eat a whiteboard
when you're stoned.</i>

144
00:09:22,436 --> 00:09:24,397
<i>- Or at least, you shouldn't.</i>
- Rooney, focus.

145
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:26,566
Okay. So, these are
all the times I've played.

146
00:09:27,441 --> 00:09:29,151
<i>And how I lost each time.</i>

147
00:09:29,235 --> 00:09:32,071
<i>Froze, froze, burnt, suffocated...</i>

148
00:09:32,154 --> 00:09:33,406
<i>- Yeah.
- Froze, and so on.</i>

149
00:09:33,489 --> 00:09:36,826
<i>I would say that you're just shit,
but I haven't done any better.</i>

150
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:41,080
<i>The superscripts here correspond
to the movements of the sun on that chart.</i>

151
00:09:41,163 --> 00:09:42,790
<i>I don't see a pattern.</i>

152
00:09:42,873 --> 00:09:45,334
That's just it.
What if there is no pattern?

153
00:09:46,127 --> 00:09:47,670
I'm gonna propose a radical idea.

154
00:09:48,379 --> 00:09:50,548
But I might need a little help from...

155
00:09:51,882 --> 00:09:52,717
<i>Francis Bacon.</i>

156
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:53,718
Francis Bacon.

157
00:09:53,801 --> 00:09:56,304
<i>All right, well,
follow your lead, just like uni.</i>

158
00:09:56,387 --> 00:09:57,388
Okay.

159
00:10:07,690 --> 00:10:09,609
<i>Level two.</i>

160
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:15,030
Ha!

161
00:10:15,781 --> 00:10:17,241
Nice. Francis Bacon.

162
00:10:17,325 --> 00:10:19,493
Yeah, two-player mode.

163
00:10:20,953 --> 00:10:23,497
England again.
So, you're in <i>my</i> game?

164
00:10:23,581 --> 00:10:26,042
Mate, I've lived
in England for 12 years.

165
00:10:26,125 --> 00:10:28,878
Maybe the game found something
we're both familiar with.

166
00:10:28,961 --> 00:10:30,546
Oh...

167
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:32,256
I don't like how it knows that.

168
00:10:33,549 --> 00:10:35,926
It better not have gone
through my search history.

169
00:10:36,010 --> 00:10:39,096
Well, if we see a girl farting
on a birthday cake, we'll know.

170
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:41,307
Copernicus!

171
00:10:41,849 --> 00:10:42,850
Sir Francis.

172
00:10:46,729 --> 00:10:48,147
Are you back to save the world?

173
00:10:48,230 --> 00:10:49,482
I hope so.

174
00:10:50,316 --> 00:10:51,651
You'd better hurry.

175
00:10:51,734 --> 00:10:53,569
The Pope is about to make his decision.

176
00:10:53,653 --> 00:10:55,738
- The Pope?
- All right. Cheers. Let's go.

177
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:57,990
Uh, I'm sorry about last time.

178
00:10:58,074 --> 00:11:00,701
And the time before that.
Well, all the times before.

179
00:11:00,785 --> 00:11:02,078
I remember them all.

180
00:11:07,416 --> 00:11:08,501
All of them?

181
00:11:09,502 --> 00:11:10,961
Every time I died.

182
00:11:12,505 --> 00:11:13,756
You'd better hurry.

183
00:11:14,256 --> 00:11:15,424
Yeah, come on.

184
00:11:22,264 --> 00:11:24,809
- Thanks.
- You'll save me this time?

185
00:11:25,851 --> 00:11:29,939
So, how are we gonna win?
Care to tell me what this radical idea is?

186
00:11:30,022 --> 00:11:31,482
What fun would that be?

187
00:11:36,696 --> 00:11:37,822
You're late.

188
00:11:38,614 --> 00:11:40,491
I was about to render my decision.

189
00:11:40,991 --> 00:11:43,285
Oh, I'm sorry, Your...

190
00:11:44,829 --> 00:11:45,913
What is it?

191
00:11:46,706 --> 00:11:47,748
Holiness.

192
00:11:48,749 --> 00:11:50,584
- Pope Gregory.
- Holy... Right.

193
00:11:50,668 --> 00:11:53,087
I'm sorry. I'm Francis Bacon.

194
00:11:53,170 --> 00:11:54,170
And I'm Copernicus.

195
00:11:54,213 --> 00:11:58,092
If either of you have a proposal
to explain the behavior of the sun,

196
00:11:58,175 --> 00:12:00,010
I will consider it now.

197
00:12:00,094 --> 00:12:01,679
I should warn you, though,

198
00:12:01,762 --> 00:12:05,975
the proposal that Aristotle
and Galileo put forth is quite strong.

199
00:12:12,064 --> 00:12:13,107
Your Holiness,

200
00:12:14,275 --> 00:12:18,529
I have made dozens of measurements
of the sun's apparent size and luminosity.

201
00:12:19,655 --> 00:12:21,240
These do not correlate.

202
00:12:21,323 --> 00:12:24,410
Second, I have noticed
the sun's position relative to this planet

203
00:12:24,493 --> 00:12:26,746
receding on a short timescale.

204
00:12:26,829 --> 00:12:30,458
Third, I have observed
more than one celestial body,

205
00:12:30,541 --> 00:12:35,087
too bright to be a planet, moving relative
to the fixed background of the stars.

206
00:12:35,713 --> 00:12:38,883
The only explanation
for these observations

207
00:12:39,592 --> 00:12:44,472
is that this planet
is part of a three-body star system.

208
00:12:46,182 --> 00:12:49,393
Fucking hell. That's the answer.

209
00:12:52,688 --> 00:12:56,984
If our planet revolves
around one of the suns in a stable orbit,

210
00:12:57,067 --> 00:12:58,611
that's a stable era.

211
00:12:59,236 --> 00:13:03,032
However, if one of the other suns
snatches our planet away,

212
00:13:03,699 --> 00:13:07,244
we wander through the gravitational fields
of all three suns.

213
00:13:07,953 --> 00:13:09,622
That's a chaotic era.

214
00:13:10,581 --> 00:13:11,832
This... This is bullshit.

215
00:13:11,916 --> 00:13:14,877
Your Holiness, you were
about to decide on <i>our</i> proposal.

216
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:15,961
Silence!

217
00:13:18,798 --> 00:13:20,549
I've heard enough.

218
00:13:24,386 --> 00:13:25,429
Burn her.

219
00:13:25,513 --> 00:13:26,722
- No, no. No, listen.
- What?

220
00:13:26,806 --> 00:13:30,684
- She's got it right. She's got evidence.
- Wait. I... I gave you the right answer!

221
00:13:31,727 --> 00:13:34,939
Heretic, I sentence you to death!

222
00:13:35,022 --> 00:13:37,107
- She's right!
- Take it like a man!

223
00:13:37,191 --> 00:13:40,351
- It's the only theory that makes sense!
- Suck it, Copernicus!

224
00:13:40,402 --> 00:13:42,363
You know she's right!
She figured it out!

225
00:13:44,949 --> 00:13:45,950
Let her go!

226
00:13:46,033 --> 00:13:47,368
No, no!

227
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,168
Copernicus!

228
00:13:57,586 --> 00:13:59,630
Three suns in the sky!

229
00:13:59,713 --> 00:14:01,257
The world is ending!

230
00:14:02,383 --> 00:14:04,093
The world is ending!

231
00:14:06,554 --> 00:14:07,847
Copernicus!

232
00:14:08,472 --> 00:14:09,348
Save me!

233
00:14:09,431 --> 00:14:11,058
Copernicus, please!

234
00:14:15,145 --> 00:14:16,897
Come on, Jin! Come on!

235
00:14:16,981 --> 00:14:17,981
Wait!

236
00:14:44,133 --> 00:14:45,718
Why are we not dead too?

237
00:14:46,927 --> 00:14:48,262
Because we were right.

238
00:15:10,284 --> 00:15:15,372
Civilization number 152
was destroyed by a tri-solar day.

239
00:15:15,456 --> 00:15:18,125
But in this civilization,
you've successfully revealed

240
00:15:18,208 --> 00:15:20,419
the basic structure of the star system.

241
00:15:21,837 --> 00:15:24,548
The game has now entered level three.

242
00:15:29,678 --> 00:15:33,140
Are you keen on video games, Clarence?

243
00:15:34,141 --> 00:15:36,060
I used to play 'em when I was a kid.

244
00:15:36,644 --> 00:15:40,773
<i>Romance of the Three Kingdoms,
Jet Set Willy</i> on ZX Spectrum<i>,</i>

245
00:15:41,732 --> 00:15:43,776
<i>Strip Poker</i> on Commodore 6...

246
00:15:43,859 --> 00:15:46,153
How would you say
this game stacks up?

247
00:15:46,236 --> 00:15:48,364
Well, listening to Cheng
and Rooney go on about it,

248
00:15:48,447 --> 00:15:50,532
it sounds like a load of bloody homework.

249
00:15:51,408 --> 00:15:55,037
Measurements, equations,
charts, observations...

250
00:15:55,621 --> 00:15:58,624
All about the way
the suns move around a fictional planet.

251
00:15:59,124 --> 00:16:00,584
<i>Suns?</i> Plural?

252
00:16:00,668 --> 00:16:04,546
Yeah. Oh, there's also a little kid
they've got to try and save.

253
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:08,008
Or Cheng's trying to save
and failing over and over.

254
00:16:08,842 --> 00:16:11,387
That's the only bit
that sounds like a proper game to me.

255
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:13,263
What's Engineering got to say about this?

256
00:16:13,347 --> 00:16:14,682
No luck getting it to work,

257
00:16:14,765 --> 00:16:17,935
but they did identify
some very interesting components.

258
00:16:18,018 --> 00:16:20,270
<i>It's got a retinal scanner,</i>

259
00:16:20,354 --> 00:16:22,815
<i>an oxygen meter, and a brain wave sensor.</i>

260
00:16:22,898 --> 00:16:25,859
<i>It's collecting a heap of biometric data.</i>

261
00:16:25,943 --> 00:16:29,238
<i>So while you're playing the game,
someone at the other end is playing you.</i>

262
00:16:30,406 --> 00:16:32,366
It's a recruitment tool.

263
00:16:32,449 --> 00:16:34,576
They're goin' after
our best and brightest.

264
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:37,579
Yeah. But recruitment for what?

265
00:16:43,836 --> 00:16:45,462
Oh fuck.

266
00:16:48,007 --> 00:16:49,007
Hi.

267
00:16:49,049 --> 00:16:50,259
Hey.

268
00:16:51,093 --> 00:16:53,220
I, uh... I thought you were out
with your mates.

269
00:16:53,303 --> 00:16:54,888
It's 3:00 a.m.

270
00:16:55,597 --> 00:16:59,977
Sorry, babe. I was, um...
just playing the game with Jack.

271
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:01,603
Yeah, I know.

272
00:17:01,687 --> 00:17:03,480
He logged off.

273
00:17:03,564 --> 00:17:05,232
Wow. It's a mess. I know.

274
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:10,320
I was gonna tidy up
before you got here. Uh...

275
00:17:10,404 --> 00:17:12,698
You lose your tether
when you're not working.

276
00:17:12,781 --> 00:17:16,660
There's nothing to be done at work,
so I'm... just taking my holiday leave.

277
00:17:16,744 --> 00:17:19,413
This isn't a holiday.

278
00:17:24,084 --> 00:17:25,794
Should I postpone dinner?

279
00:17:26,879 --> 00:17:28,088
What? No.

280
00:17:28,714 --> 00:17:29,798
Why?

281
00:17:29,882 --> 00:17:32,468
You've been dreading
meeting my parents for weeks.

282
00:17:32,551 --> 00:17:34,219
I haven't been dreading it.

283
00:17:36,096 --> 00:17:37,264
Look, I can't wait.

284
00:17:37,806 --> 00:17:39,349
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

285
00:17:42,728 --> 00:17:44,271
They're gonna love you.

286
00:17:44,354 --> 00:17:45,939
Just be yourself, yeah?

287
00:17:46,523 --> 00:17:47,523
Mm.

288
00:17:47,858 --> 00:17:50,319
But maybe go easy on the science talk?

289
00:17:51,195 --> 00:17:52,395
Higher dimensions exist,

290
00:17:52,446 --> 00:17:55,133
but we can't perceive them
because we're three-dimensional creatures.

291
00:17:55,157 --> 00:17:58,994
For instance, seen from a distance,
this bread is just a flat circle, right?

292
00:17:59,078 --> 00:18:01,455
But when you go closer,
you see that it has thickness,

293
00:18:01,538 --> 00:18:02,956
an extra dimension.

294
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:04,041
Amazing, right?

295
00:18:04,124 --> 00:18:06,335
And what's hidden
inside that extra dimension?

296
00:18:06,418 --> 00:18:07,961
More flat circles.

297
00:18:08,045 --> 00:18:11,590
And many more layers
within layers within layers.

298
00:18:11,673 --> 00:18:13,884
A whole universe inside every bite.

299
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:19,181
But that's all, um, theoretical.

300
00:18:19,264 --> 00:18:21,975
So, theoretically,
I've just eaten an entire universe.

301
00:18:23,727 --> 00:18:25,479
And it's delicious, Mrs. Varma.

302
00:18:27,523 --> 00:18:29,066
A top physicist.

303
00:18:29,149 --> 00:18:31,318
Your parents must be very proud.

304
00:18:33,070 --> 00:18:35,864
Well, I think
the whole idea is fascinating.

305
00:18:36,490 --> 00:18:37,490
Please, tell us more.

306
00:18:37,533 --> 00:18:39,535
Well, we don't need to make her do that.

307
00:18:39,618 --> 00:18:41,954
You don't wanna talk about
the curry shop all day, do you?

308
00:18:42,037 --> 00:18:43,455
I've stories of the Kargil War.

309
00:18:43,539 --> 00:18:45,457
- Here it comes.
- Yeah, go on, Dad.

310
00:18:45,541 --> 00:18:47,709
It's not dinner
until the Kargil War comes up.

311
00:18:47,793 --> 00:18:52,214
Back when you were a baby,
I was in the Indian army.

312
00:18:52,297 --> 00:18:54,591
I was captain of a platoon
up in the Himalayas,

313
00:18:54,675 --> 00:18:57,761
and the air is very thin there.

314
00:18:57,845 --> 00:19:01,390
And my soldiers were
about to die of hypoxia.

315
00:19:04,351 --> 00:19:06,728
There was an enemy camp 100 meters away,

316
00:19:06,812 --> 00:19:09,606
but it was almost
straight up a cliff face.

317
00:19:10,482 --> 00:19:14,111
I had no other choice.
I had to climb up the ice.

318
00:19:14,194 --> 00:19:17,656
And when I got to the top, I played dead.

319
00:19:18,407 --> 00:19:19,741
Not just play.

320
00:19:20,284 --> 00:19:21,994
I was nearly dead.

321
00:19:24,163 --> 00:19:29,418
But I laid there, slowly freezing,
until the Pakistani soldiers all came out,

322
00:19:29,501 --> 00:19:32,838
and that's when I threw my grenade.

323
00:19:34,882 --> 00:19:36,091
I killed them all.

324
00:19:38,051 --> 00:19:42,764
And I took the oxygen and supplies
from their camp back to my men.

325
00:19:47,019 --> 00:19:48,437
And we all survived.

326
00:19:52,774 --> 00:19:53,692
Wow.

327
00:19:53,775 --> 00:19:58,238
Yeah, that... tiny win
tipped the balance of the entire conflict.

328
00:19:58,864 --> 00:20:01,200
And it won my father the Param Vir Chakra.

329
00:20:01,283 --> 00:20:03,785
It's the... the highest
military honor in India.

330
00:20:03,869 --> 00:20:04,870
Well,

331
00:20:05,913 --> 00:20:08,207
you can't eat a medal, <i>hai, nah?</i>

332
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:12,377
People in the UK, they don't care
what you did back in India.

333
00:20:14,922 --> 00:20:17,966
Well, Jin gets the highest civilian honor.

334
00:20:18,759 --> 00:20:21,053
Surviving dinner with the Varmas.

335
00:20:21,136 --> 00:20:22,471
To Jin.

336
00:20:22,554 --> 00:20:23,388
To Jin.

337
00:20:23,472 --> 00:20:25,224
- To Jin.
- To Jin.

338
00:20:35,734 --> 00:20:37,736
Aye-aye, there he is.

339
00:20:38,362 --> 00:20:39,529
There's our boy.

340
00:20:40,364 --> 00:20:42,699
How did it go?
Scrape it all out, did they?

341
00:20:42,783 --> 00:20:43,784
You needn't have come.

342
00:20:43,867 --> 00:20:46,662
They're discharging me tomorrow
once the "Deluded" wears off.

343
00:20:46,745 --> 00:20:47,746
Dilaudid?

344
00:20:48,914 --> 00:20:50,165
Deluded.

345
00:20:50,249 --> 00:20:51,249
Don't...

346
00:20:53,710 --> 00:20:55,295
It went okay, though, yeah?

347
00:20:55,379 --> 00:20:56,964
Oh yeah. It was brilliant.

348
00:20:57,047 --> 00:20:59,007
Yeah. We had a lovely chat
while I was under.

349
00:20:59,716 --> 00:21:00,842
"We"?

350
00:21:00,926 --> 00:21:02,636
Yeah, me and the cancer.

351
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:06,139
Oh right. Is that a... Is that a metaphor?

352
00:21:06,223 --> 00:21:07,223
No.

353
00:21:07,808 --> 00:21:08,809
No, we spoke.

354
00:21:08,892 --> 00:21:14,022
It turns out that
the cancer's not inherently evil, right?

355
00:21:14,106 --> 00:21:17,651
It's just... It's actually
just looking for a place to live.

356
00:21:17,734 --> 00:21:19,820
Like we all are, I suppose.

357
00:21:19,903 --> 00:21:21,280
With its children.

358
00:21:21,363 --> 00:21:24,908
Which is fair enough, but obviously,
I said, "That's not all right with me."

359
00:21:24,992 --> 00:21:28,161
"I'm using my body
at the moment."

360
00:21:28,245 --> 00:21:30,122
"Can't just move in."

361
00:21:30,205 --> 00:21:32,082
So anyways, we made a... a deal.

362
00:21:32,833 --> 00:21:35,627
It gets to stay
in its own little corner in my pancreas,

363
00:21:36,211 --> 00:21:37,921
and I keep all the rest.

364
00:21:38,630 --> 00:21:40,549
I still think you should have told Jin.

365
00:21:40,632 --> 00:21:41,800
She knows.

366
00:21:43,302 --> 00:21:45,012
On some level, she knows.

367
00:21:46,346 --> 00:21:49,599
Which is why
you have to save her... from him.

368
00:21:52,060 --> 00:21:54,021
Who? Raj?

369
00:21:54,104 --> 00:21:55,981
He's always smiling, isn't he?

370
00:21:56,064 --> 00:21:57,107
Always friendly.

371
00:21:57,607 --> 00:21:58,900
He is death.

372
00:21:59,735 --> 00:22:01,528
He is chaos.

373
00:22:04,489 --> 00:22:05,866
You've got a funny hat on.

374
00:22:15,167 --> 00:22:17,711
Do I? I thought you'd never notice.

375
00:22:19,588 --> 00:22:20,756
Where's yours?

376
00:22:22,924 --> 00:22:24,509
I'm an instinct man.

377
00:22:24,593 --> 00:22:26,345
It's never led me astray,

378
00:22:27,471 --> 00:22:28,722
except in marriage.

379
00:22:29,723 --> 00:22:31,767
You've a reputation for rigor,

380
00:22:33,143 --> 00:22:35,103
and I believe the science to be sound.

381
00:22:35,187 --> 00:22:36,188
It <i>is</i> sound.

382
00:22:36,271 --> 00:22:38,648
What applications you had
for your nanofiber.

383
00:22:39,274 --> 00:22:42,819
Water filtration, tissue engineering,
carbon capture...

384
00:22:42,903 --> 00:22:44,571
And I still believe in it.

385
00:22:46,615 --> 00:22:48,742
Then you can see why I'm a bit flummoxed

386
00:22:49,659 --> 00:22:51,870
that you've closed down
the entire bun fight.

387
00:22:52,371 --> 00:22:53,747
It's temporary.

388
00:22:54,539 --> 00:22:56,917
I just need time
to recheck the engineering.

389
00:22:59,086 --> 00:23:02,214
Honestly, Dr. Salazar, what am I missing?

390
00:23:02,297 --> 00:23:04,383
We're on the precipice
of being first to market

391
00:23:04,466 --> 00:23:07,010
with a unique nanofiber technology,

392
00:23:08,345 --> 00:23:10,013
and you slam on the brakes.

393
00:23:10,514 --> 00:23:11,514
Why?

394
00:23:11,973 --> 00:23:15,352
We've got the finest scientists
doing the finest work in the field.

395
00:23:15,435 --> 00:23:17,396
Save for a CSO

396
00:23:18,688 --> 00:23:21,024
who seems to be having a mental breakdown.

397
00:23:23,860 --> 00:23:26,863
Luckily, as you've led us
to the precipice,

398
00:23:26,947 --> 00:23:29,908
we can easily
start the project back up again,

399
00:23:29,991 --> 00:23:32,077
if you persist in refusing.

400
00:23:40,335 --> 00:23:42,379
None of this works without me.

401
00:23:42,462 --> 00:23:45,090
Then for heaven's sake, act like a CSO.

402
00:23:45,632 --> 00:23:48,760
Think of the hundreds of employees,
think of the billions who would benefit

403
00:23:48,844 --> 00:23:50,345
from our nanofibers.

404
00:23:51,847 --> 00:23:53,682
I don't wish to be harsh,

405
00:23:54,182 --> 00:23:55,517
but please remember,

406
00:23:56,309 --> 00:23:58,437
we sponsor your ILR.

407
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:02,649
You can't stay in this country
on a work visa if you're not working.

408
00:24:03,233 --> 00:24:05,694
That's not how it bloody well goes.

409
00:25:12,511 --> 00:25:13,553
Stop.

410
00:25:14,346 --> 00:25:16,139
Stop. Stop!

411
00:25:33,365 --> 00:25:35,867
Pick up the phone.
Pick up the fucking phone.

412
00:25:44,334 --> 00:25:45,168
Hey.

413
00:25:45,252 --> 00:25:47,921
Hey. The countdown came back.

414
00:25:48,922 --> 00:25:50,507
<i>What?</i>

415
00:25:50,590 --> 00:25:52,842
I activated the reaction chamber,
and it came back.

416
00:25:52,926 --> 00:25:53,802
The numbers were here,

417
00:25:53,885 --> 00:25:55,762
and I could see them,
and I don't know why.

418
00:25:55,845 --> 00:25:57,685
Why did you do that?
You said you shut it down.

419
00:25:57,722 --> 00:25:59,182
<i>Of course I fucking shut it down.</i>

420
00:25:59,266 --> 00:26:01,268
Okay. Then why
did you turn it back on, Auggie?

421
00:26:01,351 --> 00:26:03,728
<i>'Cause I needed to know if it was real.</i>

422
00:26:03,812 --> 00:26:06,064
<i>Auggie, it's real. We both saw it.</i>

423
00:26:06,982 --> 00:26:08,858
<i>We're gonna figure this out.</i>

424
00:26:08,942 --> 00:26:10,235
I think I...

425
00:26:11,236 --> 00:26:15,073
I know why scientists
are killing themselves. I understand.

426
00:26:15,156 --> 00:26:16,491
Don't talk like that.

427
00:26:16,575 --> 00:26:18,827
<i>I'm not gonna do anything. I just...</i>

428
00:26:19,411 --> 00:26:21,162
<i>Can you please come over?</i>

429
00:26:21,246 --> 00:26:22,289
Yeah, of... of course.

430
00:26:22,372 --> 00:26:23,707
Uh, you at the lab?

431
00:26:24,374 --> 00:26:27,752
<i>- Where are you?</i>
- I'm at home... I'm at home.

432
00:26:28,336 --> 00:26:29,713
<i>Where are you going?</i>

433
00:26:31,798 --> 00:26:33,174
Are you with someone?

434
00:26:35,594 --> 00:26:37,971
I'm on my way to you, right now.
I'll be right there.

435
00:26:38,054 --> 00:26:38,930
<i>You're with someone.</i>

436
00:26:39,014 --> 00:26:40,307
Auggie, I'm coming to you.

437
00:26:40,390 --> 00:26:42,684
<i>I'm coming to you
as fast as I can, and we'll...</i>

438
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:50,442
Busy? Cancel it.

439
00:26:51,026 --> 00:26:52,235
I thought you were with Raj.

440
00:26:52,319 --> 00:26:54,696
I told him that you just got dumped
by your girlfriend.

441
00:26:54,779 --> 00:26:56,948
- I haven't got a girlfriend.
- No shit.

442
00:26:57,616 --> 00:26:59,576
Where's your headset?

443
00:27:01,286 --> 00:27:02,287
<i>Level three.</i>

444
00:27:04,623 --> 00:27:06,291
Where is this supposed to be?

445
00:27:07,083 --> 00:27:08,835
I think we're in Shangdu.

446
00:27:09,794 --> 00:27:10,795
Sometimes known as...

447
00:27:10,879 --> 00:27:15,133
Xanadu. Where Kublai Khan
decreed his stately pleasure-dome.

448
00:27:19,638 --> 00:27:22,223
Okay. We know
we're in a three-star system.

449
00:27:22,307 --> 00:27:26,061
We know we can't predict the motions
of three bodies in space. Not for long.

450
00:27:26,144 --> 00:27:27,687
Classic three-body problem.

451
00:27:27,771 --> 00:27:30,565
And there's famously
no general solution for it.

452
00:27:31,066 --> 00:27:33,746
Unless, of course, you managed
to whip one up on the tube ride over.

453
00:27:33,818 --> 00:27:34,944
Look.

454
00:27:35,028 --> 00:27:36,237
There she is.

455
00:27:39,824 --> 00:27:41,159
Hey.

456
00:27:42,118 --> 00:27:43,662
We can't speak to anyone.

457
00:27:44,788 --> 00:27:46,164
Oh, right.

458
00:27:46,247 --> 00:27:47,666
You're in the army.

459
00:27:48,375 --> 00:27:50,585
Well, we're gonna save you this time.

460
00:27:51,795 --> 00:27:53,505
Like all the other times before?

461
00:27:53,588 --> 00:27:54,673
Come on.

462
00:27:55,632 --> 00:27:57,467
- Come on. The game's this way.
- Wait.

463
00:27:57,550 --> 00:27:59,636
You're running out of chances, Copernicus.

464
00:27:59,719 --> 00:28:02,180
Soon the world will end for good.

465
00:28:13,566 --> 00:28:18,780
Great Khan, I present to you
Copernicus and Sir Francis Bacon.

466
00:28:22,283 --> 00:28:23,785
Oh, come on.

467
00:28:23,868 --> 00:28:26,996
We were just about to demonstrate
our solution, Great Khan.

468
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:29,457
Yes, yes. It's all in place.

469
00:28:29,541 --> 00:28:32,127
But do our newcomers
have an alternate proposal?

470
00:28:33,503 --> 00:28:34,503
Do we?

471
00:28:34,921 --> 00:28:38,299
Well, Great Khan,
we consider this problem to be impossible.

472
00:28:38,383 --> 00:28:39,634
Never mind, then.

473
00:28:39,718 --> 00:28:42,595
You may observe Sir Isaac Newton
and Professor Turing.

474
00:28:42,679 --> 00:28:45,473
Maybe you'll learn something
for next time.

475
00:28:45,557 --> 00:28:49,269
I have developed
a science I call "calculus"

476
00:28:49,352 --> 00:28:51,229
to predict the movement of the suns.

477
00:28:51,312 --> 00:28:57,527
And these calculations are performed
by my great Human Abacus.

478
00:29:11,791 --> 00:29:13,418
How many soldiers are there?

479
00:29:14,294 --> 00:29:15,920
Thirty million.

480
00:29:16,463 --> 00:29:18,631
None of the men
are mathematicians, of course,

481
00:29:18,715 --> 00:29:23,428
but they do all know how to hold a flag,
one way or the other.

482
00:29:23,928 --> 00:29:26,055
Ones and zeros.

483
00:29:27,307 --> 00:29:28,892
You've built a human computer.

484
00:29:29,517 --> 00:29:32,103
Let's get on with the calculations.

485
00:29:32,187 --> 00:29:34,439
When is the next chaotic era?

486
00:29:34,522 --> 00:29:36,399
Right away, Great Khan.

487
00:29:39,444 --> 00:29:42,947
Run solar orbit computation software,

488
00:29:43,031 --> 00:29:46,201
Three Body 1.0.

489
00:30:02,842 --> 00:30:03,885
Jesus.

490
00:30:06,054 --> 00:30:08,306
From here, it looks like
they've got a winner.

491
00:30:08,389 --> 00:30:09,432
Just wait.

492
00:30:25,907 --> 00:30:27,200
To the palace!

493
00:30:46,177 --> 00:30:48,555
What does your Human Abacus say?

494
00:30:49,931 --> 00:30:52,350
A chaotic era will commence in three days.

495
00:30:52,433 --> 00:30:54,352
It will last eight months,

496
00:30:54,435 --> 00:30:57,772
followed by a stable era of 10,000 years.

497
00:30:59,732 --> 00:31:02,861
Soldiers! Dehydrate!

498
00:31:02,944 --> 00:31:06,072
Eight months and three days!

499
00:31:09,576 --> 00:31:13,496
<i>All right.
Eight months and three days.</i>

500
00:31:26,593 --> 00:31:28,761
<i>A stable era once again.</i>

501
00:31:32,307 --> 00:31:33,766
<i>How long has it been?</i>

502
00:31:33,850 --> 00:31:37,520
Eight months
and three days exactly.

503
00:31:38,938 --> 00:31:42,984
Great Khan, our computer
has proven its worth.

504
00:31:43,067 --> 00:31:44,068
We've won.

505
00:31:47,614 --> 00:31:49,699
- That can't be it.
- Uh-uh.

506
00:31:49,782 --> 00:31:50,909
Did they figure it out?

507
00:31:50,992 --> 00:31:52,452
Not according to modern physics.

508
00:31:52,535 --> 00:31:54,746
They'd need the starting parameters
of all three bodies.

509
00:31:54,829 --> 00:31:56,372
You shut the fuck up, troll.

510
00:31:56,456 --> 00:31:57,582
Our computer works.

511
00:31:57,665 --> 00:31:59,602
Your calculations won't hold up
in the long run...

512
00:31:59,626 --> 00:32:01,336
Silence! Guards.

513
00:32:09,302 --> 00:32:10,178
Boil them.

514
00:32:10,261 --> 00:32:12,013
No. No, no, no. Wait.

515
00:32:12,096 --> 00:32:13,264
- Wait.
- Ow! Hang on.

516
00:32:13,348 --> 00:32:15,058
- Get off!
- This isn't right.

517
00:32:15,141 --> 00:32:17,226
I haven't had a chance
to explain properly.

518
00:32:17,310 --> 00:32:18,704
- It doesn't work.
- Fuck off!

519
00:32:18,728 --> 00:32:20,939
- Those calculations won't work!
- Oh shit!

520
00:32:28,821 --> 00:32:29,821
Oh fuck!

521
00:32:29,864 --> 00:32:31,658
They're trying to kill us!

522
00:32:31,741 --> 00:32:33,618
I'm done with this fucking game!

523
00:32:33,701 --> 00:32:36,287
Focus, Rooney!
It's all in your head! We're okay!

524
00:32:52,595 --> 00:32:54,722
Great Khan, stop her.

525
00:32:54,806 --> 00:32:56,307
It's her.

526
00:32:56,391 --> 00:32:57,517
But this is <i>our</i> game.

527
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:58,810
Look, Great Khan!

528
00:33:04,357 --> 00:33:06,484
All in a line.

529
00:33:07,402 --> 00:33:08,569
It's syzygy.

530
00:33:08,653 --> 00:33:11,114
So what? They're eclipsing one another.

531
00:33:11,197 --> 00:33:13,658
The planet is no hotter
than it was before.

532
00:33:15,159 --> 00:33:17,078
What's happened to my army?

533
00:33:26,546 --> 00:33:30,008
The planet's under the gravitational force
of all three suns.

534
00:33:31,592 --> 00:33:32,427
No!

535
00:33:50,194 --> 00:33:52,572
Charlatans! Both of you!

536
00:33:57,410 --> 00:33:59,495
Help! Copernicus!

537
00:34:00,621 --> 00:34:01,831
- No. No!
- Save me!

538
00:34:03,541 --> 00:34:05,918
- No! No!
- Save me!

539
00:34:06,002 --> 00:34:07,682
Got ya!

540
00:34:08,713 --> 00:34:09,630
No!

541
00:34:16,262 --> 00:34:18,473
It's not about solving
the three-body problem.

542
00:34:18,556 --> 00:34:20,975
Our goal is to save the people.

543
00:34:21,059 --> 00:34:23,269
The Count said survival is everything.

544
00:34:23,352 --> 00:34:26,898
<i>That's</i> the object of the game,
to help them survive.

545
00:34:26,981 --> 00:34:30,068
How the hell do we do that?
Nothing can survive here.

546
00:34:53,132 --> 00:34:55,885
Civilization number 184
was destroyed

547
00:34:55,968 --> 00:34:59,972
by the stacked gravitational attractions
of a tri-solar syzygy.

548
00:35:00,056 --> 00:35:02,934
But in this civilization,
you've correctly determined

549
00:35:03,017 --> 00:35:04,685
your true purpose in the game.

550
00:35:05,186 --> 00:35:07,605
You have now entered level four.

551
00:35:29,085 --> 00:35:30,128
Come in.

552
00:35:31,921 --> 00:35:32,922
Mr. Evans.

553
00:35:33,589 --> 00:35:34,423
Felix.

554
00:35:34,507 --> 00:35:37,844
Sir, we have two new candidates
for Region Six.

555
00:35:37,927 --> 00:35:42,265
The female, Copernicus,
is quite attached to the young Follower.

556
00:35:42,765 --> 00:35:44,267
That doesn't surprise me.

557
00:35:44,350 --> 00:35:47,478
Let's have these two vetted
for the London summit.

558
00:35:47,562 --> 00:35:48,562
Sir.

559
00:35:54,777 --> 00:35:56,988
Apologies, my Lord.

560
00:35:58,156 --> 00:35:59,157
Now.

561
00:36:01,075 --> 00:36:02,201
Where was I?

562
00:36:03,786 --> 00:36:04,829
Oh yes.

563
00:36:05,538 --> 00:36:08,958
"The Tale of Hansel
and Gretel."

564
00:36:10,084 --> 00:36:12,837
<i>You said the boy, Hansel, was afraid,</i>

565
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:13,963
<i>but the girl was not?</i>

566
00:36:14,046 --> 00:36:15,214
Not at the moment, no.

567
00:36:15,715 --> 00:36:18,634
<i>But why is one afraid
while the other is not?</i>

568
00:36:18,718 --> 00:36:21,470
<i>Do individuals experience fear
on their own?</i>

569
00:36:21,971 --> 00:36:24,432
It's an individual emotion, yes.

570
00:36:25,141 --> 00:36:28,269
<i>For us, fear is something
we experience as one.</i>

571
00:36:29,145 --> 00:36:31,189
Our ancestors were like that.

572
00:36:31,939 --> 00:36:34,984
Tiny mammals who survived by hiding.

573
00:36:35,067 --> 00:36:37,445
<i>But it appears
you have ceased to be afraid.</i>

574
00:36:37,945 --> 00:36:39,530
Why do you say that?

575
00:36:40,114 --> 00:36:42,533
<i>You contacted another planet.</i>

576
00:36:42,617 --> 00:36:44,660
<i>Is this the act of a timid species?</i>

577
00:36:44,744 --> 00:36:48,122
Not a species. No, my Lord.

578
00:36:48,623 --> 00:36:49,624
A woman.

579
00:36:50,374 --> 00:36:52,668
A singular, fearless woman.

580
00:36:53,169 --> 00:36:55,087
<i>Are there other fearless humans?</i>

581
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:57,882
Well, they show up from time to time.

582
00:36:57,965 --> 00:37:02,970
And we often look up to them
as inspirations for others to follow.

583
00:37:08,726 --> 00:37:11,437
<i>A lack of fear leads to extinction.</i>

584
00:37:12,230 --> 00:37:14,857
<i>If your ancestors
had followed the fearless,</i>

585
00:37:15,691 --> 00:37:16,943
<i>you would not exist.</i>

586
00:37:18,402 --> 00:37:20,655
<i>Humanity</i> must <i>learn to fear again.</i>

587
00:37:23,366 --> 00:37:24,825
Then we will teach them.

588
00:37:53,354 --> 00:37:55,481
Let me see the invite.

589
00:38:28,055 --> 00:38:31,434
Dr. Cheng, Mr. Rooney.

590
00:38:32,268 --> 00:38:34,020
Congratulations.

591
00:38:34,770 --> 00:38:38,024
You are the only two people
in the UK to make it this far.

592
00:38:47,283 --> 00:38:50,119
We've been so impressed by your work.

593
00:38:50,202 --> 00:38:56,500
Your help, Mr. Rooney, in identifying
the game parameters was essential.

594
00:38:56,584 --> 00:38:58,064
As was your support for your partner.

595
00:38:58,127 --> 00:38:59,211
Oh, cheers.

596
00:38:59,754 --> 00:39:01,922
And you, Dr. Cheng.

597
00:39:02,006 --> 00:39:05,801
You figured out that the home world
was part of a three-body system.

598
00:39:05,885 --> 00:39:10,014
A few other players did that as well,
but you understood what truly mattered.

599
00:39:10,639 --> 00:39:13,768
Not the planet... but its people.

600
00:39:14,477 --> 00:39:15,853
You felt their plight.

601
00:39:16,437 --> 00:39:20,274
Your cingulate cortex activity
was the highest we've ever recorded.

602
00:39:21,650 --> 00:39:23,527
Yeah, listen. About that.

603
00:39:23,611 --> 00:39:28,157
This interface, there's nothing else
like it anywhere.

604
00:39:28,657 --> 00:39:31,994
This isn't next gen.
This is five nexts down the line.

605
00:39:32,578 --> 00:39:33,996
So who are you really?

606
00:39:34,705 --> 00:39:38,250
The answers to all of your questions
are waiting for you in level four.

607
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:41,462
Whenever you're ready.

608
00:40:02,024 --> 00:40:03,275
<i>Level four.</i>

609
00:40:06,237 --> 00:40:07,613
It's a wasteland.

610
00:40:14,537 --> 00:40:16,014
Dr. Cheng.

611
00:40:16,038 --> 00:40:17,038
Mr. Rooney.

612
00:40:17,581 --> 00:40:18,707
You made it.

613
00:40:20,167 --> 00:40:21,502
You were right.

614
00:40:21,585 --> 00:40:24,672
There is no solution
to the three-body problem.

615
00:40:35,766 --> 00:40:39,979
No computer can predict the behavior
of three bodies indefinitely.

616
00:40:43,524 --> 00:40:48,154
With three suns in the sky,
every civilization ends in chaos.

617
00:40:49,905 --> 00:40:53,534
There will eventually be a cataclysm
from which we cannot recover.

618
00:40:53,617 --> 00:40:56,287
Our planet will be ripped in half.

619
00:40:57,121 --> 00:40:59,165
Or pulled into one of the suns.

620
00:40:59,248 --> 00:41:01,459
Or expelled into space forever.

621
00:41:10,843 --> 00:41:13,387
And when you know
your planet is doomed,

622
00:41:14,263 --> 00:41:15,681
what is the solution?

623
00:41:16,807 --> 00:41:17,808
Flee.

624
00:41:18,767 --> 00:41:20,102
Find a new home.

625
00:41:20,186 --> 00:41:21,228
Correct.

626
00:41:21,312 --> 00:41:24,648
Our only chance of survival
lies elsewhere.

627
00:41:25,608 --> 00:41:28,319
The moment we received
the invitation to your world,

628
00:41:28,402 --> 00:41:30,279
we knew our destination.

629
00:41:35,993 --> 00:41:38,954
We built
an interstellar fleet of 1,000 ships.

630
00:41:40,998 --> 00:41:44,376
They are the final hope
of civilization number 9478.

631
00:41:46,629 --> 00:41:48,172
And they are on their way.

632
00:41:58,182 --> 00:42:00,226
Most of us have to stay behind.

633
00:42:00,726 --> 00:42:01,977
But that's all right.

634
00:42:04,313 --> 00:42:07,233
If one of us survives, we all survive.

635
00:42:09,026 --> 00:42:11,529
You'll welcome us, won't you?

636
00:42:14,657 --> 00:42:16,575
Without your help, we won't make it.

637
00:42:24,083 --> 00:42:25,876
We can't wait to meet you.

638
00:42:43,143 --> 00:42:44,270
I don't quite understand.

639
00:42:44,353 --> 00:42:46,939
Are you trying to tell us
that... they're real?

640
00:42:47,439 --> 00:42:49,567
We call them the San-Ti.

641
00:42:50,693 --> 00:42:53,696
The first person
to make contact with them was from China.

642
00:42:53,779 --> 00:42:54,780
And <i>"san ti ren"</i> means

643
00:42:54,863 --> 00:42:57,324
- "three-body people" in Chinese.
- "Three-body people."

644
00:42:58,200 --> 00:43:02,788
These San-Ti <i>ren,</i>
they're on their way here?

645
00:43:02,871 --> 00:43:05,958
Coming from
an unstable three-body star system.

646
00:43:06,667 --> 00:43:07,960
Four light years away.

647
00:43:08,043 --> 00:43:09,962
Getting closer every moment.

648
00:43:10,546 --> 00:43:13,757
They created this technology
to share their story with us.

649
00:43:13,841 --> 00:43:15,801
And they look like that? Like us?

650
00:43:16,302 --> 00:43:17,803
We took a few liberties.

651
00:43:18,345 --> 00:43:19,555
Uh, for your benefit.

652
00:43:19,638 --> 00:43:23,350
So you're trying to tell us
that this game was designed by aliens?

653
00:43:23,434 --> 00:43:26,854
Think about it. You said yourself the tech
is 100 years ahead of where we are.

654
00:43:26,937 --> 00:43:30,024
Oh no, no. Yeah. Sure, yeah. Amazing AI.

655
00:43:30,107 --> 00:43:32,651
You know, Sword Lady and cute kid.

656
00:43:32,735 --> 00:43:33,569
But come on.

657
00:43:33,652 --> 00:43:36,071
What about the particle accelerators,
the blinking stars?

658
00:43:36,155 --> 00:43:38,490
Oh, Jin. This is a scam.

659
00:43:38,991 --> 00:43:41,619
This could be the only explanation
that accounts for all of it.

660
00:43:42,202 --> 00:43:45,039
Isn't the most simple explanation
usually the best? Occam's Razor?

661
00:43:45,122 --> 00:43:47,249
Oh, I'll give you Occam's Razor.

662
00:43:47,333 --> 00:43:49,835
This lunatic here
is trying to slice off a big wad of cash

663
00:43:49,918 --> 00:43:51,438
from a rich man who loves video games.

664
00:43:51,503 --> 00:43:52,963
We don't need your money.

665
00:43:53,047 --> 00:43:54,173
We have our own.

666
00:43:55,174 --> 00:43:57,301
If you don't want to be here,
you're free to go.

667
00:43:57,384 --> 00:43:59,762
All right. That's good of you.
Come on, Jin.

668
00:44:00,346 --> 00:44:03,182
Wait, Rooney. Don't you wanna know more?

669
00:44:03,265 --> 00:44:06,685
Oh, come on. This is fucking mental.
She's talking about aliens.

670
00:44:08,145 --> 00:44:09,772
I think we should stay.

671
00:44:13,192 --> 00:44:15,861
All right. Fine. I'll tell you what.

672
00:44:15,944 --> 00:44:18,548
You do you, and I'll be in the pub
when you've come to your senses.

673
00:44:18,572 --> 00:44:21,033
No, Rooney. Jack.

674
00:44:21,617 --> 00:44:22,660
Jack!

675
00:44:28,415 --> 00:44:30,084
We're holding a summit

676
00:44:30,167 --> 00:44:33,379
for you and the other level-four champions
from around the world

677
00:44:33,462 --> 00:44:35,506
to welcome you to the organization.

678
00:44:42,221 --> 00:44:43,555
I do hope you'll come.

679
00:44:46,016 --> 00:44:49,061
You must understand how the San-Ti feel.

680
00:44:49,144 --> 00:44:51,980
You were torn from your home too,
weren't you?

681
00:44:54,608 --> 00:44:55,901
The flood in Hubei.

682
00:44:57,027 --> 00:44:59,029
Before you moved to New Zealand.

683
00:45:01,699 --> 00:45:03,075
How do you know about that?

684
00:45:05,744 --> 00:45:07,246
How much do you remember?

685
00:45:09,164 --> 00:45:10,874
Not much. I was little.

686
00:45:17,840 --> 00:45:22,720
I remember my home being...
swept away in the middle of the night.

687
00:45:23,429 --> 00:45:28,308
My parents grabbing me
and tossing me onto a piece of doorframe.

688
00:45:32,563 --> 00:45:35,023
My parents being pulled under
by the currents.

689
00:45:38,986 --> 00:45:42,448
That's it.
That's the last time I ever saw them.

690
00:45:45,159 --> 00:45:46,577
They've lived on in you.

691
00:45:50,664 --> 00:45:52,458
If you survive,

692
00:45:53,751 --> 00:45:55,210
they've survived.

693
00:45:59,506 --> 00:46:01,633
We've all been lost in some way.

694
00:46:03,385 --> 00:46:04,386
Welcome.

695
00:46:07,222 --> 00:46:10,392
Let us be comrades.

696
00:46:20,068 --> 00:46:22,070
<i>♪ Arrest this man ♪</i>
