1
00:00:31,573 --> 00:00:32,573
Dr. Ye.

2
00:00:33,241 --> 00:00:34,451
Mr. Evans.

3
00:00:40,957 --> 00:00:43,752
I have to say,
I was surprised to hear from you.

4
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:47,714
I'm glad you remember me.

5
00:00:48,298 --> 00:00:50,967
Of course I remember you.
You were hard to forget.

6
00:00:51,968 --> 00:00:53,887
I'm only here for a week.

7
00:00:55,221 --> 00:00:56,681
For a conference.

8
00:00:56,765 --> 00:00:58,099
Astrophysics.

9
00:00:58,892 --> 00:01:01,811
So, you made it off of that hilltop, huh?

10
00:01:04,064 --> 00:01:05,732
I know about your father.

11
00:01:06,983 --> 00:01:08,109
I did some looking.

12
00:01:08,943 --> 00:01:10,987
I know about your father too.

13
00:01:12,155 --> 00:01:14,282
You run his oil company now.

14
00:01:14,365 --> 00:01:18,787
And Mao is dead, and I'm a professor
at Tsinghua University.

15
00:01:20,997 --> 00:01:22,248
Things change.

16
00:01:23,416 --> 00:01:25,085
Nothing has changed with me.

17
00:01:25,585 --> 00:01:27,629
I'm the same man you met in Shaanxi.

18
00:01:28,254 --> 00:01:30,381
I could've spent
the rest of my life in that hut,

19
00:01:30,465 --> 00:01:33,718
trying to save a subspecies
of the northwestern brown swallow,

20
00:01:33,802 --> 00:01:37,305
or I could use the resources
available to me to do more.

21
00:01:39,307 --> 00:01:42,227
In order to fight power,

22
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:45,522
sometimes you have to embrace power.

23
00:01:46,147 --> 00:01:48,316
I agree.

24
00:01:49,609 --> 00:01:52,737
And how are you fighting power, exactly?

25
00:01:56,866 --> 00:01:59,369
Why did you write to me?

26
00:02:01,329 --> 00:02:05,208
"In nature,
nothing exists alone."

27
00:02:07,961 --> 00:02:11,464
I did not know who else to talk to.

28
00:02:13,675 --> 00:02:15,343
What would you like to talk about?

29
00:02:18,054 --> 00:02:19,764
Back on that hilltop...

30
00:02:24,018 --> 00:02:25,478
...I did something.

31
00:02:52,338 --> 00:02:55,425
Hey, um, discharge was an hour ago.

32
00:02:55,967 --> 00:02:58,303
So text me if you can't make it, but, um,

33
00:02:59,345 --> 00:03:01,472
I'm ready to go whenever you are.

34
00:03:13,985 --> 00:03:14,986
Oh, hey.

35
00:03:16,112 --> 00:03:17,112
Hey.

36
00:03:18,573 --> 00:03:20,325
I thought you were at Oxford.

37
00:03:20,992 --> 00:03:21,992
Yeah, uh...

38
00:03:22,702 --> 00:03:23,870
I was.

39
00:03:25,413 --> 00:03:27,957
Well, welcome back.

40
00:03:28,625 --> 00:03:31,377
Jack was supposed to pick me up
like an hour ago,

41
00:03:31,461 --> 00:03:33,838
but the bastard
won't even answer his phone.

42
00:03:36,174 --> 00:03:37,174
You okay?

43
00:03:41,804 --> 00:03:42,805
Why are you here?

44
00:03:57,820 --> 00:04:00,156
Stop it. Stop. Stop it now.

45
00:04:04,744 --> 00:04:06,162
I should have stopped him.

46
00:04:06,913 --> 00:04:08,915
Hey. Hey. It wasn't your fault.

47
00:04:08,998 --> 00:04:11,042
It must be the same woman, right?

48
00:04:11,793 --> 00:04:13,294
The one who lit my cigarette?

49
00:04:13,378 --> 00:04:15,922
Maybe she erased herself
from the footage like last time.

50
00:04:16,005 --> 00:04:17,882
Could be her,
could be someone she works with.

51
00:04:17,966 --> 00:04:21,386
Well, find her.
That's what you people do, isn't it?

52
00:04:21,469 --> 00:04:24,639
There's 18 security cameras
in and around your mate's house.

53
00:04:25,306 --> 00:04:27,350
She doesn't show up on any of them.

54
00:04:27,433 --> 00:04:29,143
Strange, isn't it?

55
00:04:30,687 --> 00:04:33,564
Vera Ye recruited
five pet geniuses to Oxford.

56
00:04:33,648 --> 00:04:35,692
Now, Vera and one of her pets are dead.

57
00:04:36,901 --> 00:04:39,070
An invitation. Three circles on it.

58
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:42,573
And how the fuck do you know about that?

59
00:04:42,657 --> 00:04:43,658
Does it matter?

60
00:04:57,297 --> 00:04:58,798
Isn't that interesting?

61
00:04:59,757 --> 00:05:02,552
They want you to stop work,
and they want you to work for them.

62
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:09,142
Next week, a meeting
to welcome you to the organization.

63
00:05:09,225 --> 00:05:10,727
I'm going with her.

64
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:12,437
- No, you're not.
- Yes, I am.

65
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:13,813
No, you're not.

66
00:05:13,896 --> 00:05:15,231
You were not invited.

67
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:18,318
You have a choice, Doctor Cheng.

68
00:05:19,027 --> 00:05:20,862
You can go home, mourn your friend,

69
00:05:20,945 --> 00:05:24,866
spend the rest of your life wishing
you'd acted differently the night he died,

70
00:05:25,366 --> 00:05:27,827
or you can help us
catch the cunts who murdered him.

71
00:05:31,205 --> 00:05:33,374
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

72
00:05:33,458 --> 00:05:34,625
Drink the vodka.

73
00:05:34,709 --> 00:05:37,587
- I'd like those better than the vodka.
- No, drink the vodka.

74
00:05:40,048 --> 00:05:41,341
Drink it for real.

75
00:05:57,648 --> 00:05:59,317
You know, I really tried.

76
00:06:00,568 --> 00:06:02,070
He just wouldn't shut up.

77
00:06:02,612 --> 00:06:04,197
He had to go and pick a fight with her.

78
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:06,741
Then I was trying to give him a look,
and he wouldn't shut up.

79
00:06:06,824 --> 00:06:09,535
It's okay, Jin.
Who could ever get Jack to shut up?

80
00:06:13,247 --> 00:06:14,791
I think they're real.

81
00:06:16,167 --> 00:06:17,168
Who?

82
00:06:17,251 --> 00:06:18,669
The San-Ti.

83
00:06:18,753 --> 00:06:20,588
I think they're real, and they're coming.

84
00:06:21,547 --> 00:06:23,800
- I know it sounds insane, I...
- It's not insane.

85
00:06:23,883 --> 00:06:25,718
It's the only thing that makes sense.

86
00:06:26,427 --> 00:06:29,097
What they've been doing,
we don't have that technology.

87
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:30,306
Nobody does.

88
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:33,893
So, if nobody can do it,
and it's still happening, it's...

89
00:06:34,602 --> 00:06:37,522
I don't know how to fight aliens.

90
00:06:37,605 --> 00:06:39,315
Neither do I, but guess what?

91
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:43,069
The people that work
for them... aren't aliens.

92
00:06:43,569 --> 00:06:46,364
And I've been fighting people
my whole life.

93
00:06:47,198 --> 00:06:48,449
So have you.

94
00:07:02,839 --> 00:07:04,006
More good news.

95
00:07:04,549 --> 00:07:05,716
We found him.

96
00:07:06,884 --> 00:07:08,719
Panamax oil tanker.

97
00:07:08,803 --> 00:07:11,097
Hasn't delivered oil in 40 years.

98
00:07:11,597 --> 00:07:14,100
Could be 1,000 people living on there.

99
00:07:14,767 --> 00:07:15,935
Got the coordinates.

100
00:07:16,018 --> 00:07:19,939
Mediterranean Sea,
200 miles north of Alexandria.

101
00:07:20,857 --> 00:07:22,066
Do we move?

102
00:07:22,733 --> 00:07:23,860
No.

103
00:07:24,485 --> 00:07:25,403
We wait.

104
00:07:49,051 --> 00:07:50,052
<i>Hola.</i>

105
00:07:51,345 --> 00:07:53,222
<i>Monsieur</i> Evans!

106
00:07:53,306 --> 00:07:55,183
Gabrielle, <i>bonjour.</i>

107
00:07:55,391 --> 00:07:57,727
Mrs. Chiang was telling us
about the San-Ti.

108
00:07:57,810 --> 00:07:58,686
Yes.

109
00:07:58,769 --> 00:08:02,190
Will I live long enough to meet our Lord?

110
00:08:03,024 --> 00:08:07,153
If our Lord wants us to be here
when they arrive,

111
00:08:07,737 --> 00:08:10,865
then they'll make that possible.

112
00:08:11,616 --> 00:08:14,160
They can work miracles.

113
00:08:14,702 --> 00:08:16,746
And if not?

114
00:08:16,996 --> 00:08:19,207
Then that's what's best, isn't it?

115
00:08:19,457 --> 00:08:20,457
Yes.

116
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:27,673
Sir, our final roster
for tomorrow's summit in London.

117
00:08:28,424 --> 00:08:31,594
- What happened to Rooney?
- He didn't work out.

118
00:08:32,345 --> 00:08:33,513
I see.

119
00:08:33,596 --> 00:08:35,139
- Sir?
- Hmm?

120
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:37,350
Should we increase security?

121
00:08:37,433 --> 00:08:39,727
What security can we provide
that the Lord can't?

122
00:08:40,561 --> 00:08:42,188
Yes.

123
00:08:49,612 --> 00:08:50,696
My Lord?

124
00:08:52,031 --> 00:08:53,031
<i>Yes.</i>

125
00:08:53,074 --> 00:08:56,702
We have new comrades
joining us through the game.

126
00:08:56,786 --> 00:08:58,680
For the London summit tomorrow,
we're planning...

127
00:08:58,704 --> 00:09:00,289
<i>They know about the summit.</i>

128
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:03,084
"They"?

129
00:09:03,167 --> 00:09:04,502
<i>Your enemies.</i>

130
00:09:05,628 --> 00:09:07,046
<i>They know where you are.</i>

131
00:09:07,755 --> 00:09:09,507
<i>They are watching you right now.</i>

132
00:09:14,554 --> 00:09:15,846
<i>Don't be afraid.</i>

133
00:09:16,389 --> 00:09:17,974
<i>Nothing will happen to you.</i>

134
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:20,518
<i>Not to any of you.</i>

135
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:22,895
<i>We will protect you.</i>

136
00:09:25,898 --> 00:09:29,026
<i>That's better. It's nice to see you smile.</i>

137
00:09:38,369 --> 00:09:40,162
Fuck's sake.

138
00:09:40,246 --> 00:09:42,081
What's the point of this one again?

139
00:09:42,665 --> 00:09:45,668
- Uh, winning.
- There's a lot of blood.

140
00:09:45,751 --> 00:09:48,879
Yeah, the boss smashed through
my rib cage and snatched my heart.

141
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:50,506
He's the Heart Snatcher.

142
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:52,216
Oh, very nice.

143
00:09:53,050 --> 00:09:56,512
- How is the job hunt going?
- I've got a job.

144
00:09:57,305 --> 00:09:59,265
- What?
- I'm an entrepreneur.

145
00:09:59,348 --> 00:10:01,767
That's not a job.
That's a word you learned to pronounce.

146
00:10:01,851 --> 00:10:04,312
Yeah, you think I'm such a loser,
but wait and see.

147
00:10:04,395 --> 00:10:07,440
I don't think you're a loser.
Just think you're lazy.

148
00:10:07,523 --> 00:10:11,110
Yeah. Well, you've slogged your guts out,
and look what you've got to show for it.

149
00:10:12,278 --> 00:10:15,323
"Everything the light touches
is our kingdom."

150
00:10:17,325 --> 00:10:19,577
My job isn't about getting rich.

151
00:10:20,119 --> 00:10:21,537
About protecting people.

152
00:10:22,997 --> 00:10:24,707
Oh, you think that's funny, huh?

153
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:27,543
Sorry, Dad.
I just don't think the police are heroes.

154
00:10:27,627 --> 00:10:29,003
Well, I'm not police.

155
00:10:29,086 --> 00:10:32,173
Yeah, you're a functionary
for a dysfunctional government.

156
00:10:34,383 --> 00:10:35,426
Who told you that?

157
00:10:35,509 --> 00:10:37,386
It's an original thought, Dad.

158
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:39,680
I know the po-po discourage those.

159
00:10:41,098 --> 00:10:42,975
Ally said it.

160
00:10:43,934 --> 00:10:45,311
Ally's a twat.

161
00:10:45,394 --> 00:10:48,034
You've been saying that for two years,
but he's still my boyfriend.

162
00:10:48,064 --> 00:10:49,148
So what does that tell you?

163
00:10:49,231 --> 00:10:51,192
That you've got terrible taste in men?

164
00:10:51,275 --> 00:10:52,943
Guess I take after my mum.

165
00:11:00,284 --> 00:11:03,120
When I make my millions
and I buy you a sweet pad,

166
00:11:03,204 --> 00:11:05,289
I'm gonna be like,
"Still think I'm a loser?"

167
00:11:11,879 --> 00:11:13,964
First, you better kill the Heart Snatcher.

168
00:11:14,048 --> 00:11:16,008
Almost had him that time.

169
00:11:33,192 --> 00:11:34,192
Hey.

170
00:11:35,152 --> 00:11:36,195
What do you think?

171
00:11:37,947 --> 00:11:39,532
Yeah, that should be all right.

172
00:11:40,032 --> 00:11:42,243
His mum said it would be a closed coffin.

173
00:11:52,586 --> 00:11:58,134
Do you, uh, think there's anything we need
to get rid of before his family gets here?

174
00:11:58,759 --> 00:11:59,759
Like what?

175
00:12:00,761 --> 00:12:04,140
I don't know. Uh, sex toys, happy pills.

176
00:12:05,182 --> 00:12:08,853
Vintage porn. I mean...
...this is Jack Rooney we're talking about.

177
00:12:10,312 --> 00:12:11,564
I don't think so.

178
00:12:14,567 --> 00:12:15,568
Ah, see?

179
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:18,821
Told you.

180
00:12:24,201 --> 00:12:26,412
What do you think? It's, uh, handcuffs?

181
00:12:26,996 --> 00:12:28,080
Anal beads?

182
00:13:19,006 --> 00:13:21,967
I do data and equations
and hypotheses and models.

183
00:13:22,051 --> 00:13:24,470
I don't do... this.

184
00:13:25,262 --> 00:13:27,348
I'm not a spy, or whatever you are.

185
00:13:27,932 --> 00:13:29,683
We know where you're heading.

186
00:13:29,767 --> 00:13:32,353
We'll be close by, watching and listening,

187
00:13:33,062 --> 00:13:34,814
making sure you're safe.

188
00:13:35,397 --> 00:13:38,275
Best thing you can do
is avoid conversations altogether.

189
00:13:38,359 --> 00:13:40,486
Don't talk. Listen.

190
00:13:41,195 --> 00:13:44,114
You're there for information,
not confrontation.

191
00:13:44,198 --> 00:13:47,034
The longer you stay, the more we learn.

192
00:13:47,117 --> 00:13:50,621
You go in,
you gather the intelligence, you leave.

193
00:13:50,704 --> 00:13:51,956
No one is the wiser.

194
00:13:52,039 --> 00:13:53,457
Oh, bring a bag.

195
00:13:53,958 --> 00:13:57,086
Clothes, toothpaste...
enough for a few nights.

196
00:13:57,169 --> 00:13:59,463
- Why?
- Just in case.

197
00:13:59,547 --> 00:14:00,881
What? In case of what?

198
00:14:00,965 --> 00:14:02,800
In case you can't go home.

199
00:14:04,009 --> 00:14:05,553
Why wouldn't I be able to go home?

200
00:14:05,636 --> 00:14:08,138
They know
where you live, Dr. Cheng.

201
00:14:12,351 --> 00:14:14,103
When you say "they,"

202
00:14:15,604 --> 00:14:17,314
who are you really talking about?

203
00:14:19,775 --> 00:14:22,319
Do you think
they're in contact with aliens?

204
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:26,824
You don't need to believe in Santa Claus
to believe people give gifts on Christmas.

205
00:14:29,410 --> 00:14:31,370
Do you believe in Santa Claus?

206
00:14:39,169 --> 00:14:40,462
Ho ho ho.

207
00:15:13,245 --> 00:15:14,245
Hello?

208
00:15:14,663 --> 00:15:17,791
<i>Don't take your phone inside
when you get to the location.</i>

209
00:15:17,875 --> 00:15:19,835
Will you still be able to track me?

210
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:21,378
<i>I hope you're kidding.</i>

211
00:15:21,879 --> 00:15:24,214
<i>Green light.</i>

212
00:15:33,766 --> 00:15:36,477
"And she looked
at the Big Bad Wolf and said,

213
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:39,188
'Grandma, what big eyes you've got.'"

214
00:15:39,271 --> 00:15:41,273
<i>We do not understand.</i>

215
00:15:41,357 --> 00:15:43,359
What don't you understand?

216
00:15:44,109 --> 00:15:46,445
<i>- He intends to eat her.</i>
- Yes.

217
00:15:47,488 --> 00:15:49,031
<i>She does not want to be eaten.</i>

218
00:15:49,114 --> 00:15:50,616
No.

219
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:52,952
<i>So why does she remain in the house</i>

220
00:15:53,035 --> 00:15:55,496
<i>when she knows
the wolf intends to eat her?</i>

221
00:15:55,579 --> 00:15:57,498
Uh, she doesn't know.

222
00:15:57,998 --> 00:16:00,626
The wolf is pretending
to be the grandmother.

223
00:16:01,502 --> 00:16:03,087
<i>We do not understand.</i>

224
00:16:03,963 --> 00:16:06,173
Well, he's dressed like the grandmother.

225
00:16:06,256 --> 00:16:10,135
He's wearing her clothes.
He looks like her. He sounds like her.

226
00:16:11,512 --> 00:16:13,430
<i>But he is</i> not <i>the grandmother.</i>

227
00:16:13,514 --> 00:16:14,515
<i>He is the wolf.</i>

228
00:16:14,598 --> 00:16:18,435
Yes, but, uh, Little Red Riding Hood
doesn't know that.

229
00:16:19,186 --> 00:16:21,480
<i>The Wolf has communicated with her?</i>

230
00:16:22,272 --> 00:16:23,440
He has.

231
00:16:24,608 --> 00:16:27,319
<i>If he wanted to achieve
his aim of eating her,</i>

232
00:16:27,403 --> 00:16:29,279
<i>why did he communicate with her?</i>

233
00:16:29,947 --> 00:16:33,701
<i>After he communicated with her,
and she learned his intentions,</i>

234
00:16:33,784 --> 00:16:34,952
<i>why didn't she run?</i>

235
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:40,374
Uh, because she didn't learn
his intentions.

236
00:16:40,457 --> 00:16:43,085
He was hiding them from her.

237
00:16:43,877 --> 00:16:46,005
Don't you ever hide your intentions?

238
00:16:48,757 --> 00:16:50,384
<i>We do not understand.</i>

239
00:16:51,093 --> 00:16:55,723
Well, for instance, the, um, you know...
these pests who are tracking us,

240
00:16:55,806 --> 00:16:58,017
they're trying to hide their intentions

241
00:16:58,100 --> 00:17:01,520
because, well, otherwise,
they couldn't get to us.

242
00:17:03,897 --> 00:17:04,897
<i>Pests?</i>

243
00:17:05,315 --> 00:17:06,567
Our enemies.

244
00:17:07,067 --> 00:17:10,237
The intelligence operatives
you warned me about.

245
00:17:11,572 --> 00:17:13,323
<i>Pests are destructive insects</i>

246
00:17:13,407 --> 00:17:16,994
<i>or other animals that attack
crops, food, and livestock.</i>

247
00:17:17,077 --> 00:17:18,537
<i>Your enemies are human.</i>

248
00:17:18,620 --> 00:17:19,705
Yes.

249
00:17:19,788 --> 00:17:23,792
Yes, well, uh, you see, well...
What I was doing there, I was, um...

250
00:17:24,877 --> 00:17:26,670
I was using a metaphor.

251
00:17:27,796 --> 00:17:31,884
I was describing them as pests
because, well, that's what they are.

252
00:17:32,384 --> 00:17:36,055
Annoying, inconsequential,
easy to eliminate.

253
00:17:37,139 --> 00:17:41,185
Like bugs you can squash under your shoe.

254
00:17:44,646 --> 00:17:47,775
Can't you ever say anything
that you know to be false?

255
00:17:47,858 --> 00:17:49,026
Can't you lie?

256
00:17:50,861 --> 00:17:54,907
<i>What is known is communicated
as soon as communication takes place.</i>

257
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:00,662
So, you communicate through thought?

258
00:18:02,164 --> 00:18:07,461
While we are still like barnyard animals,
squawking at each other.

259
00:18:08,754 --> 00:18:11,590
<i>You do this? You lie?</i>

260
00:18:12,257 --> 00:18:15,094
Well, I... I try not to, but, um...

261
00:18:16,011 --> 00:18:17,011
Yeah.

262
00:18:17,513 --> 00:18:21,308
Yeah, we all do sometimes.
One way or another.

263
00:18:22,101 --> 00:18:24,603
<i>And the wolf, he is also lying?</i>

264
00:18:25,646 --> 00:18:28,440
Yeah. Yeah, I suppose he is.

265
00:18:30,526 --> 00:18:32,236
<i>We would like to speak to him.</i>

266
00:18:34,446 --> 00:18:35,614
What?

267
00:18:35,697 --> 00:18:37,741
<i>Is he still in the grandmother's house?</i>

268
00:18:37,825 --> 00:18:38,909
<i>Where is that?</i>

269
00:18:39,952 --> 00:18:41,954
Uh, in the forest.

270
00:18:43,914 --> 00:18:44,998
<i>Which forest?</i>

271
00:18:45,624 --> 00:18:47,584
<i>There are many forests on your world.</i>

272
00:18:47,668 --> 00:18:48,877
Oh no.

273
00:18:49,461 --> 00:18:51,255
No, no, no. It's not...

274
00:18:51,338 --> 00:18:52,965
It's... It's not real.

275
00:18:54,508 --> 00:18:55,759
<i>We do not understand.</i>

276
00:18:55,843 --> 00:18:57,261
Well, it's a story.

277
00:18:58,095 --> 00:19:01,849
You know, the wolf, the grandmother,
the, well, Little Red Riding Hood.

278
00:19:01,932 --> 00:19:03,517
None of them exist.

279
00:19:06,103 --> 00:19:07,521
<i>So the story,</i>

280
00:19:08,438 --> 00:19:10,357
<i>it is a lie about a liar?</i>

281
00:19:11,859 --> 00:19:12,943
Yeah.

282
00:19:14,069 --> 00:19:15,529
Yeah, I suppose it is.

283
00:19:21,243 --> 00:19:22,911
<i>We need to consider this.</i>

284
00:19:28,792 --> 00:19:29,918
My Lord?

285
00:19:33,797 --> 00:19:34,798
My Lord?

286
00:19:37,217 --> 00:19:39,052
<i>We think we understand now.</i>

287
00:19:39,761 --> 00:19:40,804
Ah.

288
00:19:41,889 --> 00:19:43,265
See, that's, um...

289
00:19:44,057 --> 00:19:47,477
That's why you need us, my Lord.

290
00:19:48,729 --> 00:19:50,147
We can help you.

291
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:53,984
Help you understand us better.

292
00:19:56,862 --> 00:19:59,489
<i>A liar is someone whose words are false.</i>

293
00:19:59,990 --> 00:20:01,783
<i>A liar cannot be trusted.</i>

294
00:20:02,784 --> 00:20:04,912
<i>We cannot coexist with liars.</i>

295
00:20:04,995 --> 00:20:07,039
My Lord...

296
00:20:10,167 --> 00:20:11,167
Uh...

297
00:20:11,877 --> 00:20:12,878
My Lord?

298
00:20:15,130 --> 00:20:16,715
<i>We are afraid of you.</i>

299
00:20:21,428 --> 00:20:22,471
My Lord...

300
00:20:29,728 --> 00:20:31,313
My Lord, are you there?

301
00:20:34,274 --> 00:20:35,359
My Lord?

302
00:20:38,946 --> 00:20:40,739
My Lord, are you there?

303
00:22:28,597 --> 00:22:29,931
Welcome, Dr. Cheng.

304
00:22:50,077 --> 00:22:52,412
<i>Where exactly are we going?</i>

305
00:22:52,496 --> 00:22:54,039
<i>To the summit.</i>

306
00:22:54,664 --> 00:22:56,458
<i>What's happening at the summit?</i>

307
00:22:57,667 --> 00:23:00,379
Don't worry.
Our Lord'll take care of us all.

308
00:23:01,630 --> 00:23:02,881
"Our Lord"?

309
00:24:15,954 --> 00:24:16,955
Jin!

310
00:24:20,333 --> 00:24:21,835
I'm glad you made it.

311
00:24:22,502 --> 00:24:23,503
I am too.

312
00:24:26,339 --> 00:24:28,258
I'm so sorry about your friend.

313
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:34,055
<i>- I didn't think you'd come.</i>
- I know that voice.

314
00:24:34,139 --> 00:24:37,058
<i>- If I missed this meeting...</i>
- I met her at the graveyard.

315
00:24:37,142 --> 00:24:39,269
<i>She's known about us all along.</i>

316
00:24:39,352 --> 00:24:41,581
- And that surprises you?
<i>- So, what made you come?</i>

317
00:24:41,605 --> 00:24:44,983
<i>I want to know
why the universe works the way it does.</i>

318
00:24:45,066 --> 00:24:46,735
I want the big answers.

319
00:24:47,235 --> 00:24:49,821
If anyone knows those answers,
it's our Lord.

320
00:24:50,489 --> 00:24:51,489
Yes.

321
00:24:52,365 --> 00:24:55,076
I trust in our Lord to provide them.

322
00:24:56,369 --> 00:24:58,538
I know it feels strange
to say it at first.

323
00:24:58,622 --> 00:25:01,333
It makes us all sound
like religious loons.

324
00:25:01,416 --> 00:25:04,377
Except <i>our</i> Lord is real.

325
00:25:06,379 --> 00:25:10,258
You haven't had anyone protecting you
since the flood took your family away.

326
00:25:11,051 --> 00:25:12,177
Now you do.

327
00:25:13,178 --> 00:25:16,056
This has been my family
since I was a little girl.

328
00:25:17,307 --> 00:25:19,476
It's an honor to be part of the family.

329
00:25:20,352 --> 00:25:22,771
I know someone
who'll be very happy to hear that.

330
00:25:23,396 --> 00:25:25,273
Our founder is coming.

331
00:25:26,608 --> 00:25:29,027
How did Evans get off that boat
without us seeing him?

332
00:25:29,110 --> 00:25:31,830
<i>How did that girl scrub herself
from the security cameras?</i>

333
00:25:31,905 --> 00:25:34,074
<i>- Everyone, if I could...</i>
- Do we move on 'em?

334
00:25:34,157 --> 00:25:36,743
<i>No, let's listen.
He might admit to something.</i>

335
00:25:36,826 --> 00:25:39,204
It's wonderful to see all your faces,
old and new.

336
00:25:40,247 --> 00:25:42,707
It's a very special night
for us all to be here.

337
00:25:42,791 --> 00:25:46,378
The rumors are true,
so I'll get out of your way.

338
00:25:46,461 --> 00:25:50,507
I am honored to introduce
the founder of our movement,

339
00:25:51,174 --> 00:25:52,425
our reason for hope,

340
00:25:52,509 --> 00:25:54,469
the cause of our salvation.

341
00:25:55,595 --> 00:25:58,139
Everyone, please welcome our founder...

342
00:26:00,392 --> 00:26:02,644
...Dr. Ye Wenjie!

343
00:26:22,914 --> 00:26:24,082
Welcome.

344
00:26:24,541 --> 00:26:26,543
I knew you'd come.

345
00:26:38,888 --> 00:26:42,142
There's been nothing
connecting her to this since the funeral.

346
00:26:42,225 --> 00:26:43,810
<i>Nothing we've seen or heard.</i>

347
00:26:43,893 --> 00:26:46,771
But they've been controlling
what we see and hear.

348
00:26:46,855 --> 00:26:49,274
<i>So how come
they're letting us hear this?</i>

349
00:26:56,364 --> 00:26:57,532
Thank you.

350
00:27:01,119 --> 00:27:02,787
When I was a young woman,

351
00:27:03,788 --> 00:27:06,499
I saw my country torn apart.

352
00:27:07,417 --> 00:27:09,794
My family was destroyed.

353
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:12,756
I was sent to hell.

354
00:27:14,007 --> 00:27:17,510
I saw human beings
cut each other to pieces,

355
00:27:17,594 --> 00:27:19,971
destroy each other without a thought,

356
00:27:20,055 --> 00:27:22,849
all in the name of progress.

357
00:27:24,601 --> 00:27:26,144
And what has changed?

358
00:27:26,686 --> 00:27:32,067
We continue to destroy each other
and the world around us.

359
00:27:32,150 --> 00:27:34,986
We cannot save ourselves.

360
00:27:35,862 --> 00:27:38,698
But we are not alone.

361
00:27:39,658 --> 00:27:41,242
Four light-years away,

362
00:27:41,326 --> 00:27:46,498
the San-Ti have achieved miracles
beyond our wildest imagination,

363
00:27:46,581 --> 00:27:49,876
in spite of the chaos
that plagues their world.

364
00:27:50,627 --> 00:27:55,882
And now, they are coming
to share their knowledge with us,

365
00:27:55,965 --> 00:27:59,928
to teach us how to survive and to thrive.

366
00:28:00,553 --> 00:28:03,598
They travel to us at enormous speeds,

367
00:28:03,682 --> 00:28:06,768
but it will take them centuries to arrive.

368
00:28:06,851 --> 00:28:08,561
Four hundred years.

369
00:28:08,645 --> 00:28:10,146
Four hundred years?

370
00:28:10,647 --> 00:28:11,731
<i>Space is big.</i>

371
00:28:11,815 --> 00:28:14,234
<i>...in history falls to us</i>

372
00:28:14,317 --> 00:28:18,238
and to our children,
and to their children after them.

373
00:28:18,321 --> 00:28:21,408
We must prepare the world
for their arrival

374
00:28:21,491 --> 00:28:25,578
and prepare our descendants
to welcome them.

375
00:28:31,292 --> 00:28:33,545
I believe all our guests have arrived.

376
00:28:33,628 --> 00:28:35,296
I thank you.

377
00:28:36,172 --> 00:28:40,385
My partner in this movement,
Mike Evans, thanks you.

378
00:28:40,468 --> 00:28:44,013
And our Lord, the San-Ti, thanks you.

379
00:28:45,682 --> 00:28:49,144
We will give them the gift of our world,

380
00:28:49,686 --> 00:28:52,689
so that they can do with it
what we could not,

381
00:28:53,273 --> 00:28:55,275
so that they can mend

382
00:28:55,358 --> 00:28:56,651
what we have brok...

383
00:28:58,653 --> 00:29:00,822
Down on the ground!

384
00:29:00,905 --> 00:29:02,115
Move!

385
00:29:05,326 --> 00:29:06,411
Get down!

386
00:29:06,494 --> 00:29:07,579
Get down!

387
00:29:16,379 --> 00:29:17,464
Stop!

388
00:29:18,923 --> 00:29:20,550
Do not resist.

389
00:29:22,927 --> 00:29:24,512
If this is happening,

390
00:29:25,388 --> 00:29:26,890
it is our Lord's will.

391
00:29:26,973 --> 00:29:29,142
<i>Please.</i>

392
00:29:29,225 --> 00:29:30,268
Sit down.

393
00:29:44,324 --> 00:29:46,993
Our Lord will protect us
from our enemies.

394
00:29:53,082 --> 00:29:54,584
Hey.

395
00:30:09,766 --> 00:30:11,726
Come on. Let's get you out.

396
00:31:01,734 --> 00:31:03,361
Come on. Come on.

397
00:31:39,314 --> 00:31:40,565
There you go.

398
00:31:46,446 --> 00:31:47,655
How are you doing?

399
00:31:48,823 --> 00:31:51,868
We're gonna take you somewhere safe.
Your friend Auggie too.

400
00:31:52,410 --> 00:31:54,454
Just till we get a handle on this.

401
00:31:54,537 --> 00:31:57,957
You got lucky. I'm a terrible shot.

402
00:33:43,521 --> 00:33:44,521
Hello?

403
00:33:44,939 --> 00:33:45,939
<i>Hey.</i>

404
00:33:46,983 --> 00:33:48,109
Hey.

405
00:33:49,986 --> 00:33:52,905
<i>I... I just wanted to check in
and see how you were doing.</i>

406
00:33:55,074 --> 00:33:56,075
Yeah, I'm...

407
00:33:57,618 --> 00:33:58,619
okay.

408
00:33:59,954 --> 00:34:06,002
So, I was thinking, after Jack's funeral,
we could maybe all use a bit of a break.

409
00:34:06,961 --> 00:34:12,133
Um, I've... I've rented
this little cottage on the beach

410
00:34:12,216 --> 00:34:14,093
<i>down by Seven Sisters.</i>

411
00:34:14,177 --> 00:34:17,930
<i>So, I mean, I don't know if you feel
like staring at the Channel but...</i>

412
00:34:18,014 --> 00:34:19,265
That sounds nice.

413
00:34:20,975 --> 00:34:22,685
I'll invite Saul and Auggie.

414
00:34:23,895 --> 00:34:26,105
And Raj, of course.

415
00:34:27,190 --> 00:34:29,400
Maybe it should just be us chickens.

416
00:34:30,401 --> 00:34:32,278
<i>He's back at base anyway.</i>

417
00:34:34,322 --> 00:34:37,366
Auggie could make us her famous palomas.

418
00:34:38,367 --> 00:34:40,078
We could drink them on the beach.

419
00:34:40,161 --> 00:34:42,371
<i>They say you can see France
on a clear day.</i>

420
00:34:42,455 --> 00:34:43,664
Hmm.

421
00:34:45,333 --> 00:34:46,918
<i>Are you driving somewhere?</i>

422
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:50,546
Uh, yeah.

423
00:34:52,173 --> 00:34:53,174
<i>Where?</i>

424
00:34:55,426 --> 00:34:57,595
I don't know exactly.

425
00:34:58,930 --> 00:34:59,930
Somewhere safe.

426
00:35:02,725 --> 00:35:03,893
What's going on?

427
00:35:05,019 --> 00:35:07,313
<i>Nothing. I'm... I'm okay. I promise.</i>

428
00:35:07,396 --> 00:35:10,274
Jin, where are you?
I'll... I'll come and get you.

429
00:35:14,070 --> 00:35:16,030
I have to tell you something.

430
00:35:17,448 --> 00:35:20,701
Something fucking insane but true.

431
00:35:21,202 --> 00:35:22,912
Jin, what's happening?

432
00:35:22,995 --> 00:35:24,497
<i>Just listen, okay?</i>

433
00:35:25,248 --> 00:35:29,127
<i>It's about all of us.
It's about you and me and Jack.</i>

434
00:35:30,336 --> 00:35:31,546
All of us.

435
00:35:35,466 --> 00:35:37,885
It started a long time ago.

436
00:35:39,762 --> 00:35:41,347
Before we were born.

437
00:36:01,367 --> 00:36:02,743
What do you think?

438
00:36:04,996 --> 00:36:07,957
It's like seeing an old friend.

439
00:36:12,295 --> 00:36:15,214
<i>Clear the helipad. Clear the helipad.</i>

440
00:36:16,174 --> 00:36:17,550
<i>Incoming.</i>

441
00:36:18,467 --> 00:36:21,095
{\an8}<i>Clear the helipad immediately.</i>

442
00:36:42,992 --> 00:36:44,744
All right. Watch your step.

443
00:36:44,827 --> 00:36:46,287
Yeah. Here, sir.

444
00:36:46,370 --> 00:36:47,830
Watch your step.

445
00:36:54,962 --> 00:36:56,797
It's gonna be different this time.

446
00:36:58,257 --> 00:37:00,009
Our own research base.

447
00:37:02,845 --> 00:37:04,180
Why here?

448
00:37:05,556 --> 00:37:07,516
No borders. No politics.

449
00:37:08,809 --> 00:37:10,144
No interference.

450
00:37:18,069 --> 00:37:19,695
Our transmission center.

451
00:37:25,201 --> 00:37:28,412
It took me eight years
to receive a response last time.

452
00:37:29,121 --> 00:37:30,456
We might have to wait.

453
00:37:31,123 --> 00:37:33,334
They've been trying to reach you
this whole time.

454
00:37:33,876 --> 00:37:34,752
What?

455
00:37:34,835 --> 00:37:36,963
Ever since they got your message.

456
00:37:37,046 --> 00:37:39,882
You left the base
before they could reply again.

457
00:37:43,678 --> 00:37:45,554
You're very important to them.

458
00:37:46,430 --> 00:37:48,641
They're curious to learn more about us,

459
00:37:48,724 --> 00:37:50,851
and they want to teach us
about themselves.

460
00:37:51,435 --> 00:37:53,145
It was so long ago.

461
00:37:56,607 --> 00:37:58,901
Sometimes I wondered if it was real.

462
00:38:00,695 --> 00:38:01,737
It's real.

463
00:38:04,490 --> 00:38:05,533
They're coming.

464
00:38:09,287 --> 00:38:11,789
You have brought us hope.

465
00:38:52,246 --> 00:38:53,789
We know about the ship.

466
00:39:01,255 --> 00:39:03,090
What's on Judgment Day?

467
00:39:03,174 --> 00:39:05,009
Why is it so important?

468
00:39:05,092 --> 00:39:09,180
If you're as clumsy as you were
at our meeting, you'll never find out.

469
00:39:09,263 --> 00:39:12,516
- We have you, don't we?
- And why do you think that is?

470
00:39:13,100 --> 00:39:15,519
You've got me because they let you.

471
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:19,065
Well, judging by the number
of casualties on your side,

472
00:39:19,148 --> 00:39:21,317
I wouldn't say you <i>let</i> us do anything.

473
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:22,943
We didn't let you.

474
00:39:23,027 --> 00:39:24,403
<i>They</i> let you.

475
00:39:26,447 --> 00:39:29,450
You have no idea what they can do.

476
00:39:29,533 --> 00:39:33,788
You think you do, but you don't.

477
00:39:34,914 --> 00:39:36,707
They are coming.

478
00:39:38,209 --> 00:39:40,920
And there's nothing
you can do to stop them.

479
00:39:43,547 --> 00:39:45,424
And when they arrive...

480
00:39:48,969 --> 00:39:51,597
you'll be so grateful.
