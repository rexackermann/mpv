1
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:10,360
Sir, it's no good!

2
00:01:10,779 --> 00:01:13,531
The flames have spread to the forest
in the Third District!

3
00:01:14,032 --> 00:01:16,534
Send more choppers! We need air support!

4
00:01:16,618 --> 00:01:18,912
At this rate, the whole mountain range
is gonna go up!

5
00:01:19,496 --> 00:01:22,540
Damn it all! I don't get how
it's covering so much ground!

6
00:01:35,553 --> 00:01:37,180
What... what's happened here?

7
00:01:44,229 --> 00:01:46,898
The trees, they're flattened.

8
00:01:46,981 --> 00:01:49,275
My God. Did something crash?

9
00:01:49,359 --> 00:01:51,986
No, sir.
No reports of one, at least.

10
00:01:55,865 --> 00:01:58,118
Where are you, Mont Blanc?
Why can't I get a signal?

11
00:01:58,201 --> 00:02:01,329
- You can't be here!
- Mont Blanc! I'm coming!

12
00:02:01,871 --> 00:02:05,166
- Professor!
- Let me go!

13
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:08,002
No, Professor!
Any closer, and you'll burn alive!

14
00:02:08,086 --> 00:02:10,004
His signal's gone dead!

15
00:02:10,088 --> 00:02:14,217
Do you know what that means?
Mont Blanc's signal has gone dead!

16
00:03:17,405 --> 00:03:19,324
What's wrong, Gesicht? I heard a gasp.

17
00:03:23,203 --> 00:03:24,412
Nothing. Really.

18
00:03:25,038 --> 00:03:26,038
I'm fine, dear.

19
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:28,458
It seems like you've been so tired lately.

20
00:03:28,541 --> 00:03:32,503
I hope you're not working too hard.
Some time off might do you good.

21
00:03:32,587 --> 00:03:35,465
I'm all right. No need to fret.

22
00:03:40,261 --> 00:03:44,140
{\an8}<i>As you can see,
smoke is still rising from the forest</i>

23
00:03:44,224 --> 00:03:47,977
<i>a full two days later
as scattered fires continue to burn.</i>

24
00:03:48,478 --> 00:03:51,940
<i>According to on-site investigators,
the legendary robot</i>

25
00:03:52,023 --> 00:03:55,652
<i>assigned to the Swiss Forestry Service,
Mont Blanc himself,</i>

26
00:03:55,735 --> 00:03:59,030
<i>was found dismembered
within the blaze's ring of destruction.</i>

27
00:03:59,948 --> 00:04:03,534
{\an8}<i>Mont Blanc was known the world over
as a mountain guide without equal.</i>

28
00:04:04,535 --> 00:04:07,747
{\an8}<i>He was a friend to children
and experienced climbers alike.</i>

29
00:04:08,414 --> 00:04:13,044
<i>The robot was also a tireless advocate
for man's better stewardship of nature.</i>

30
00:04:14,754 --> 00:04:18,758
<i>Condolences for the beloved Mont Blanc
are pouring in from all over the globe.</i>

31
00:04:26,099 --> 00:04:27,725
Yes, this is Gesicht.

32
00:04:29,894 --> 00:04:33,064
Yes. Understood. I'll be right there.

33
00:04:34,524 --> 00:04:36,359
Work call. I have to go.

34
00:04:36,442 --> 00:04:38,319
Uh, but what about your breakfast?

35
00:04:49,622 --> 00:04:50,957
- Helena.
- Uh...

36
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:52,709
Maybe I'll take some time off.

37
00:04:52,792 --> 00:04:54,627
- We could go on a trip.
- Huh?

38
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:57,588
I should be getting more rest,
don't you think?

39
00:04:58,798 --> 00:05:01,551
You're right, but I never thought
I'd hear you say it.

40
00:05:22,071 --> 00:05:25,700
Bernard Lanke, 42 years old,
killed in his apartment.

41
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:28,870
Big advocate
for the International Robot Laws.

42
00:05:31,289 --> 00:05:32,498
Was he a human?

43
00:05:32,582 --> 00:05:34,250
Oh. Uh, yes.

44
00:05:37,962 --> 00:05:40,882
Bad way to go. Just look at him.

45
00:05:42,175 --> 00:05:43,175
Hmm?

46
00:05:47,138 --> 00:05:48,765
Hey! You there!

47
00:05:50,058 --> 00:05:52,643
You can stop rooting
through my crime scene anytime.

48
00:05:52,727 --> 00:05:56,397
Actually, sir, we've been expecting him.
He's Europol's guy.

49
00:05:56,481 --> 00:05:57,565
Hmm?

50
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:02,278
Gesicht.

51
00:06:02,362 --> 00:06:04,572
Sorry for snapping at you like that.

52
00:06:04,655 --> 00:06:08,076
I'm Inspector Wallace
with the city police. A pleasure.

53
00:06:08,159 --> 00:06:10,995
I'm sure you've noticed,
but our killer wrecked the place.

54
00:06:11,079 --> 00:06:13,790
We're trying to figure out
if anything was stolen during the attack,

55
00:06:13,873 --> 00:06:16,000
but, uh, it's gonna take us some time.

56
00:06:16,084 --> 00:06:19,462
No, I don't think robbery
was a factor at play here.

57
00:06:19,545 --> 00:06:21,672
Huh? How do you figure?

58
00:06:22,256 --> 00:06:23,925
No sign of a search.

59
00:06:24,008 --> 00:06:26,427
Come on!
With this much damage, who can say?

60
00:06:26,511 --> 00:06:27,970
I can tell.

61
00:06:28,054 --> 00:06:30,139
This damage is from the attack itself.

62
00:06:32,683 --> 00:06:35,395
All right. Then tell me
what you make of this.

63
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:50,868
Why'd they go to the trouble
of jamming stuff into his head

64
00:06:50,952 --> 00:06:52,870
like a pair of damn horns?

65
00:06:52,954 --> 00:06:54,705
Hmm?

66
00:06:55,373 --> 00:06:56,624
Yes. Go ahead.

67
00:06:57,625 --> 00:06:59,210
Hold on. They what?

68
00:07:01,462 --> 00:07:03,622
They're saying someone attacked
one of our checkpoints!

69
00:07:19,021 --> 00:07:20,606
We need medevac! ASAP!

70
00:07:24,694 --> 00:07:27,280
Did the perp attack
anybody else, constable?

71
00:07:27,822 --> 00:07:32,118
Robby, sir.
He was at the checkpoint with me.

72
00:07:32,869 --> 00:07:34,120
He's my partner.

73
00:07:35,121 --> 00:07:37,748
Like, a constable-bot, you know?

74
00:07:37,832 --> 00:07:40,251
Model PRC1332.

75
00:07:48,259 --> 00:07:52,263
Hard to believe that a police robot
could be destroyed so easily.

76
00:07:54,682 --> 00:07:55,933
Inspector!

77
00:07:56,642 --> 00:07:59,896
We got word of a male fleeing toward
the old city's redevelopment zone.

78
00:07:59,979 --> 00:08:01,230
He matches our perp.

79
00:08:01,314 --> 00:08:04,734
Twenties, wearing a red cap,
and tattoos on both arms.

80
00:08:04,817 --> 00:08:07,195
Well, then?
Pair up and search the place!

81
00:08:07,278 --> 00:08:08,278
Huh?

82
00:08:08,321 --> 00:08:11,282
Hey! I said, "Pair up,"
you damn show-off!

83
00:08:12,283 --> 00:08:13,283
Oh!

84
00:08:13,659 --> 00:08:16,204
Damn it! Europol can kiss my ass!

85
00:09:29,735 --> 00:09:31,237
I suggest you calm down.

86
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:32,613
I didn't do anything!

87
00:09:32,697 --> 00:09:35,366
That steel pipe you're holding
has traces of material

88
00:09:35,449 --> 00:09:37,076
from a destroyed constable-bot.

89
00:09:39,245 --> 00:09:43,040
Ah. You're an addict
high on a drug called "noi."

90
00:09:43,124 --> 00:09:45,167
Taken about 40 minutes ago.

91
00:09:45,251 --> 00:09:46,251
Sound about right?

92
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:50,256
This is the part where you tell me
who you bought it from.

93
00:09:50,339 --> 00:09:55,261
A guy on Karl-Heinz Street.
I only know him as Shultz, okay?

94
00:09:55,344 --> 00:09:57,471
And when
did you last see Shultz?

95
00:09:58,222 --> 00:10:00,224
Uh, early this morning before 5:00.

96
00:10:00,308 --> 00:10:03,644
If the dealer's version of events
happens to line up with what you said,

97
00:10:03,728 --> 00:10:05,146
then you have an alibi.

98
00:10:06,314 --> 00:10:09,692
5:00 a.m. is around the time
that Bernard Lanke was murdered.

99
00:10:09,775 --> 00:10:11,819
Mu... murdered? What the...

100
00:10:11,902 --> 00:10:14,989
If I had to guess,
you attacked the officer with that pipe

101
00:10:15,072 --> 00:10:17,408
to avoid getting collared
on a drug charge.

102
00:10:18,034 --> 00:10:21,704
After him,
you destroyed a local constable-bot.

103
00:10:22,288 --> 00:10:24,808
Now, I can read you your rights
and arrest you without incident,

104
00:10:24,874 --> 00:10:25,875
or we can do this...

105
00:10:37,053 --> 00:10:38,763
Don't shoot me! Come on, man!

106
00:10:38,846 --> 00:10:40,014
You're perfectly safe.

107
00:10:40,097 --> 00:10:42,933
This gun's only equipped
to fire non-lethal sleeping gas.

108
00:10:43,517 --> 00:10:45,936
My construction forbids
the killing of a human.

109
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:47,813
{\an8}Like your victim,

110
00:10:47,897 --> 00:10:49,190
{\an8}I'm a robot too.

111
00:10:57,698 --> 00:10:59,450
<i>Yes? Who is it?</i>

112
00:10:59,950 --> 00:11:03,579
I'm Gesicht, ma'am. A detective.
I'm here on behalf of Europol.

113
00:11:05,873 --> 00:11:07,667
Can I help you?

114
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:09,752
You are Robby's wife, correct?

115
00:11:09,835 --> 00:11:10,835
Yes.

116
00:11:11,796 --> 00:11:13,714
I'm afraid I have some bad news.

117
00:11:22,098 --> 00:11:23,808
Can I offer you
a cup of tea?

118
00:11:24,308 --> 00:11:25,726
You're a robot, same as me,

119
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:28,979
so I'm sure you'll just go through
the motions of drinking it.

120
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:31,607
By living as the humans do,

121
00:11:31,691 --> 00:11:36,529
they say we robots can upgrade our senses
or refine them. Same difference, I guess.

122
00:11:37,655 --> 00:11:39,824
I suppose all that is true enough.

123
00:11:40,574 --> 00:11:44,328
But I still don't understand why
drinking tea is such a comfort to them.

124
00:11:44,954 --> 00:11:47,790
Maybe it's too subtle
for an outdated model like me.

125
00:11:50,334 --> 00:11:54,505
I have a job.
I work as a maid for this one family.

126
00:11:54,588 --> 00:11:58,384
They have a child. A boy.
All of them humans, of course.

127
00:11:59,301 --> 00:12:03,055
The parents had adopted a dog
back before the child was even born.

128
00:12:03,639 --> 00:12:06,142
The boy and the dog grew up like siblings.

129
00:12:06,976 --> 00:12:09,979
But then, one day, the dog died.

130
00:12:15,067 --> 00:12:20,030
Would it help if I were to erase
a portion of your memory data?

131
00:12:21,615 --> 00:12:24,869
My memories of him?
Please don't.

132
00:12:31,459 --> 00:12:34,253
Whole thing's a damn mess.

133
00:12:34,336 --> 00:12:37,423
The murder victim here
is one Bernard Lanke.

134
00:12:37,506 --> 00:12:39,967
The key member
of a Robot Law advocacy group.

135
00:12:40,050 --> 00:12:41,594
So I see.

136
00:12:42,136 --> 00:12:43,896
I'm sure there are
plenty of people out there

137
00:12:43,929 --> 00:12:47,683
with no love for a scholar
who pushed so hard for robot rights.

138
00:12:47,767 --> 00:12:50,686
The body was found
in the following condition.

139
00:12:54,064 --> 00:12:56,400
That supposed to be horns
coming out of his head or what?

140
00:12:56,484 --> 00:12:58,903
I'm not sure.

141
00:12:58,986 --> 00:12:59,986
However...

142
00:13:06,952 --> 00:13:09,830
- Huh?
- Huh? Don't tell me that's...

143
00:13:10,414 --> 00:13:12,458
This is how
they found Mont Blanc

144
00:13:12,541 --> 00:13:14,293
right after he was destroyed.

145
00:13:14,376 --> 00:13:15,544
More horns.

146
00:13:15,628 --> 00:13:16,462
Wait a minute!

147
00:13:16,545 --> 00:13:20,007
Are you saying that whoever tore
Mont Blanc to pieces also killed Lanke?

148
00:13:21,008 --> 00:13:24,887
Inflicting that level of damage
upon a robot as sturdy as Mont Blanc

149
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:27,097
is beyond human capability.

150
00:13:27,181 --> 00:13:31,769
Also, Lanke was the only human
in his apartment at the time of his death.

151
00:13:31,852 --> 00:13:35,272
I scanned the murder scene myself
and found no other traces.

152
00:13:35,356 --> 00:13:36,941
He was the only human in there?

153
00:13:37,024 --> 00:13:38,901
So what the hell are you suggesting?

154
00:13:38,984 --> 00:13:40,820
You know where I'm going with this.

155
00:13:40,903 --> 00:13:41,821
I do.

156
00:13:41,904 --> 00:13:44,824
The International Robot Laws, Article 13.

157
00:13:44,907 --> 00:13:47,409
No robot can harm or murder a human.

158
00:13:47,493 --> 00:13:49,620
But if... if there's a robot out there

159
00:13:49,703 --> 00:13:52,498
who's found a way
to murder human beings at will,

160
00:13:53,165 --> 00:13:56,085
then we're right back
where we were eight years ago.

161
00:14:02,174 --> 00:14:04,134
I'll track down
our perpetrator, sir.

162
00:14:04,218 --> 00:14:06,136
Whether our killer is human or robot,

163
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:09,306
there's a devil inside them,
and it must be stopped.

164
00:14:16,397 --> 00:14:19,024
A strange pedestal, isn't it?

165
00:14:19,108 --> 00:14:20,109
Back in the day,

166
00:14:20,192 --> 00:14:24,989
there was talk of building a giant statue
of Mont Blanc and putting it on top.

167
00:14:25,072 --> 00:14:28,784
However, Mont Blanc let us know
he didn't much like the idea.

168
00:14:28,868 --> 00:14:32,329
He said it would be wrong
to ruin such a scenic view of the Alps

169
00:14:32,413 --> 00:14:34,582
with a needless monument like that.

170
00:14:35,791 --> 00:14:39,753
He didn't even want us to hang onto
his body once he was nonfunctional.

171
00:14:40,504 --> 00:14:43,090
"Break it up, melt it down, recycle it."

172
00:14:43,173 --> 00:14:46,010
"No point hanging onto an empty husk,"
he would say.

173
00:14:46,552 --> 00:14:50,681
I keep thinking back
to when he was still in his prime.

174
00:14:50,764 --> 00:14:54,643
<i>Mont Blanc was a hero
in the truest sense of the word.</i>

175
00:14:56,061 --> 00:14:58,480
<i>He served in the 39th Central Asian War</i>

176
00:14:58,564 --> 00:15:00,900
<i>as a key member
of the peace-keeping forces.</i>

177
00:15:02,151 --> 00:15:05,112
<i>Not only did he help restore peace
in the Kingdom of Persia</i>

178
00:15:05,195 --> 00:15:06,864
<i>after the turmoil of war,</i>

179
00:15:07,448 --> 00:15:11,076
<i>but he apprehended many terrorist cells
without any bloodshed.</i>

180
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:13,120
<i>Without Mont Blanc,</i>

181
00:15:13,203 --> 00:15:16,290
<i>Asia could never have achieved
its current state of peace.</i>

182
00:15:17,625 --> 00:15:19,835
<i>He was a poet and a friend of nature.</i>

183
00:15:20,377 --> 00:15:24,340
<i>He enjoyed singing with the birds
and talking with the trees of the forest.</i>

184
00:15:25,424 --> 00:15:28,093
See those people
setting up his memorial?

185
00:15:28,177 --> 00:15:32,473
Volunteers, every single one,
because they loved him.

186
00:15:33,057 --> 00:15:36,435
They loved my son
from the bottom of their hearts.

187
00:15:37,436 --> 00:15:41,148
<i>Mont Blanc.
Guardian angel of the Alps.</i>

188
00:15:41,231 --> 00:15:44,193
Tens... No, hundreds of thousands
will come.

189
00:15:44,276 --> 00:15:47,196
They'll flock to this memorial
in three days' time...

190
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:49,907
here to grieve the passing of their hero.

191
00:15:49,990 --> 00:15:53,869
Look, Detective,
Mont Blanc's death was no accident.

192
00:15:55,412 --> 00:15:58,332
They say it was a freak tornado
that destroyed him.

193
00:15:58,415 --> 00:16:00,876
And one was reported
in the area that night

194
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:03,796
mere moments before the fire
that burned the forest,

195
00:16:03,879 --> 00:16:05,464
but that's not what killed him.

196
00:16:06,048 --> 00:16:09,426
I beg of you.
Catch whoever did this to my boy.

197
00:16:10,010 --> 00:16:14,139
Find them, and I'll beat them bloody
with my own hands!

198
00:16:14,848 --> 00:16:18,519
<i>As the pride
of Switzerland and the world at large,</i>

199
00:16:18,602 --> 00:16:20,854
<i>Mont Blanc will live on forever...</i>

200
00:16:20,938 --> 00:16:23,357
<i>...cherished in the memories
of all who knew him.</i>

201
00:16:40,416 --> 00:16:43,252
<i>Are you awake, Gesicht?
Rise and shine.</i>

202
00:16:44,003 --> 00:16:46,171
<i>That'll do it for your
scheduled maintenance today.</i>

203
00:16:46,255 --> 00:16:49,717
You have my thanks, Professor Hoffman.
So, everything normal?

204
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:52,761
<i>Yes. There's nothing out of the ordinary.</i>

205
00:16:52,845 --> 00:16:53,845
<i>Except...</i>

206
00:16:54,263 --> 00:16:55,263
Go on.

207
00:16:55,764 --> 00:16:59,101
<i>Well, most people assume
robots aren't capable of getting tired,</i>

208
00:16:59,184 --> 00:17:01,729
<i>but given how human you are
in your design,</i>

209
00:17:01,812 --> 00:17:03,397
<i>fatigue is a real possibility.</i>

210
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:04,857
And why not?

211
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:07,943
The human body is just a mechanism,
the same as you are.

212
00:17:08,027 --> 00:17:12,156
No mechanism, flesh or otherwise,
can avoid the perils of overwork.

213
00:17:12,239 --> 00:17:13,365
Overwork?

214
00:17:14,616 --> 00:17:18,120
You've got a difficult caseload
at the moment. No doubt about that.

215
00:17:18,203 --> 00:17:20,247
I tried to watch Mont Blanc's memorial,

216
00:17:20,330 --> 00:17:24,585
but I ended up turning it off
after a while to keep myself from crying.

217
00:17:25,669 --> 00:17:27,254
There's a theory that some sort of

218
00:17:27,337 --> 00:17:31,050
internal electromagnetic wave anomaly
made him self-destruct.

219
00:17:31,633 --> 00:17:34,094
But as an expert on the subject,

220
00:17:34,178 --> 00:17:36,889
I don't believe a marvel of engineering
like Mont Blanc

221
00:17:36,972 --> 00:17:40,184
could ever be taken out
by such a minor error as that.

222
00:17:41,810 --> 00:17:46,398
Destroying a robot whom everyone adored.
Do you think you can find the perpetrator?

223
00:17:49,443 --> 00:17:52,071
I'm sure that mystery
is going to prove a challenge.

224
00:17:52,946 --> 00:17:55,824
At the same time, though,
that other case you're on,

225
00:17:55,908 --> 00:17:57,701
it looks complicated too.

226
00:17:57,785 --> 00:17:59,870
The murder of Bernard Lanke.

227
00:17:59,953 --> 00:18:02,998
I watched him advocate
for robot rights on TV many a time.

228
00:18:03,082 --> 00:18:05,334
No surprise he fell afoul of someone.

229
00:18:06,043 --> 00:18:08,462
Sure, the man had a right
to defend his opinions,

230
00:18:08,545 --> 00:18:10,297
but his remarks could cut like a knife.

231
00:18:10,881 --> 00:18:13,133
He always had
an air of condescension about him.

232
00:18:13,217 --> 00:18:15,177
Not a good way to make any friends.

233
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:18,180
If you think about it,
they're the opposite of each other.

234
00:18:18,764 --> 00:18:20,599
A robot and a human being.

235
00:18:20,682 --> 00:18:23,852
One of them had no enemies,
and the other had nothing but.

236
00:18:24,353 --> 00:18:27,231
Yeah, juggling two tough cases like that
at the same time?

237
00:18:27,314 --> 00:18:29,024
That would tire out anybody.

238
00:18:30,192 --> 00:18:32,945
Do you mind
if I ask you something, Professor?

239
00:18:33,028 --> 00:18:34,279
Not at all.

240
00:18:34,363 --> 00:18:37,574
Can a human enter a room
and then commit a crime there

241
00:18:37,658 --> 00:18:39,993
without leaving
any sort of biological trace?

242
00:18:40,828 --> 00:18:42,913
In other words, organic traces so minute,

243
00:18:42,996 --> 00:18:45,374
they can't be detected
by your sensor loadout.

244
00:18:45,457 --> 00:18:47,835
- Is that what you're asking me?
- Yes.

245
00:18:47,918 --> 00:18:50,587
Uh-huh. Quite the hypothetical.

246
00:18:50,671 --> 00:18:52,714
That is gonna take some thought.

247
00:18:56,426 --> 00:18:58,637
Call it my homework for next time.

248
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:00,222
Oh, what am I saying?

249
00:19:00,305 --> 00:19:02,266
These checkups
should be your break from work.

250
00:19:02,850 --> 00:19:04,601
No more shoptalk, all right?

251
00:19:10,107 --> 00:19:12,818
Incidentally, I brought up the idea
with my wife

252
00:19:12,901 --> 00:19:15,112
of us maybe going on a little trip.

253
00:19:15,195 --> 00:19:16,738
Well, that sounds nice.

254
00:19:16,822 --> 00:19:18,657
But she has her work to think of as well,

255
00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:20,951
so who can say
when we'll get around to it.

256
00:19:21,034 --> 00:19:22,703
Traveling is healthy.

257
00:19:22,786 --> 00:19:24,705
The data is unanimous.

258
00:19:24,788 --> 00:19:26,790
Seeing more of the world
is a great experience

259
00:19:26,874 --> 00:19:28,667
for an artificial intelligence.

260
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:31,211
You should go somewhere
completely different, like Japan!

261
00:19:31,795 --> 00:19:32,921
Japan?

262
00:19:33,005 --> 00:19:33,839
Uh-huh!

263
00:19:33,922 --> 00:19:36,758
A member of their scientific community
invited me over there once,

264
00:19:36,842 --> 00:19:38,552
and I jumped at the chance to visit.

265
00:19:38,635 --> 00:19:41,763
Tokyo is so interesting.
So much to see and do!

266
00:19:41,847 --> 00:19:44,975
Sounds like fun.
I'll run the idea past my wife.

267
00:19:45,684 --> 00:19:47,519
Hope you don't mind my asking,

268
00:19:47,603 --> 00:19:50,564
but are you still having
that dream you told me about?

269
00:19:53,859 --> 00:19:54,735
I am.

270
00:19:54,818 --> 00:19:56,695
Oh! Not that I'm trying
to pry it out of you.

271
00:19:56,778 --> 00:19:58,155
That would be rude of me.

272
00:19:58,238 --> 00:20:01,617
But I am intrigued at the thought
of artificial minds having dreams.

273
00:20:02,326 --> 00:20:05,412
At this point, it's pretty well-accepted
within the scientific community

274
00:20:05,495 --> 00:20:08,707
that artificial intelligence
includes a subconscious element.

275
00:20:08,790 --> 00:20:13,086
Still, it's rare to encounter a robot that
has any waking memory of the dream state.

276
00:20:13,670 --> 00:20:16,632
When you feel up to it,
could you maybe tell me what you've seen?

277
00:20:16,715 --> 00:20:17,549
Hmm.

278
00:20:17,633 --> 00:20:20,719
As the 20th-century psychiatrist
Sigmund Freud was known

279
00:20:20,802 --> 00:20:22,304
to occasionally say,

280
00:20:22,387 --> 00:20:25,641
"Our dreams are more than just
idle flights of the imagination."

281
00:20:25,724 --> 00:20:28,018
"Dreams are expressions of our reality."

282
00:20:46,954 --> 00:20:49,122
- Excuse me, sir.
- Hmm?

283
00:20:53,252 --> 00:20:55,879
Is that a constable-bot?

284
00:20:55,963 --> 00:20:57,714
Uh-huh. Says it right there.

285
00:20:58,423 --> 00:21:01,677
Cops are done doing forensics,
so it's time to junk it.

286
00:21:02,928 --> 00:21:04,054
You're Robby.

287
00:21:04,763 --> 00:21:05,763
Hmm?

288
00:21:06,723 --> 00:21:09,601
Would you mind
if I take a quick look at him?

289
00:21:10,102 --> 00:21:11,812
Yeah, sure. Go ahead.

290
00:21:11,895 --> 00:21:14,273
If there's any parts you want,
take 'em with you.

291
00:21:14,356 --> 00:21:15,607
The body's scrap at this point.

292
00:21:20,070 --> 00:21:22,864
500 Zeus a body.
What do you say?

293
00:21:24,908 --> 00:21:25,951
What's the matter?

294
00:21:30,747 --> 00:21:33,292
Uh, it's nothing. Nothing at all.

295
00:21:35,043 --> 00:21:36,503
Zoned out for a second.

296
00:21:41,091 --> 00:21:43,176
This is
your husband's memory chip.

297
00:21:44,678 --> 00:21:47,764
Not to overstep,
but I thought you might want it.

298
00:21:48,682 --> 00:21:53,603
Oh my goodness.
This means so much to me. Thank you.

299
00:21:53,687 --> 00:21:56,023
Well then, I can see myself out.

300
00:21:57,733 --> 00:21:58,734
Wait!

301
00:21:59,318 --> 00:22:02,529
Could I trouble you to insert it, please?

302
00:22:03,905 --> 00:22:06,241
There could be painful memories on there.

303
00:22:13,498 --> 00:22:16,543
The overlapping sets of memories
could cause a malfunction.

304
00:22:16,626 --> 00:22:18,879
If that happens,
I'm ejecting it right away.

305
00:22:21,131 --> 00:22:23,842
My Robby.
He's here with me.

306
00:22:35,437 --> 00:22:38,106
Huh?

307
00:22:38,690 --> 00:22:40,567
Ma'am, that's enough! I'm taking it out!

308
00:22:40,650 --> 00:22:44,613
His final memories are clearly
too traumatic for you! I'm ejecting it!

309
00:22:45,447 --> 00:22:47,532
- That's strange.
- Huh?

310
00:22:48,658 --> 00:22:50,285
What could it be?

311
00:22:51,495 --> 00:22:54,081
- What do you see, ma'am?
- I'll display it.

312
00:23:03,715 --> 00:23:08,095
Footage of Robby's partner stopping a car
at their checkpoint before the attack.

313
00:23:13,683 --> 00:23:15,560
He takes out the human cop.

314
00:23:24,236 --> 00:23:25,695
Please forgive me.

315
00:23:26,279 --> 00:23:28,824
Seeing that firsthand
must have been traumatic.

316
00:23:29,449 --> 00:23:31,368
I can't apologize enough.

317
00:23:31,451 --> 00:23:32,911
- It's not that.
- Hmm?

318
00:23:33,537 --> 00:23:37,499
My husband, he reacted
to the sight of the steel pipe at once.

319
00:23:37,999 --> 00:23:40,544
I could see his stun gun at the ready.

320
00:23:40,627 --> 00:23:41,795
I saw that.

321
00:23:41,878 --> 00:23:44,089
It's very unusual that a human perpetrator

322
00:23:44,172 --> 00:23:46,800
can mount a successful attack
on a constable-bot.

323
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:49,320
There's a lot we still don't understand
about how...

324
00:23:49,344 --> 00:23:50,720
- I know why.
- Hmm?

325
00:23:50,804 --> 00:23:52,389
Watch the moment again.

326
00:23:55,434 --> 00:23:58,812
With this chip in me,
I can track the memory frame by frame.

327
00:23:59,521 --> 00:24:01,773
It starts when he hits Robby's partner.

328
00:24:02,357 --> 00:24:03,817
Up until this moment,

329
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:06,820
my husband never takes his eyes off
the man with the pipe.

330
00:24:07,487 --> 00:24:09,531
But as the man rushes him,

331
00:24:10,198 --> 00:24:12,993
he was distracted by something.

332
00:24:13,493 --> 00:24:14,911
There, behind him!

333
00:24:14,995 --> 00:24:17,414
That was the apartment
Lanke was murdered in!

334
00:24:20,459 --> 00:24:22,085
That shot, right there!

335
00:24:24,171 --> 00:24:26,756
- What is that thing?
- I can zoom in some.

336
00:24:29,634 --> 00:24:31,595
Definitely not a bird.

337
00:24:31,678 --> 00:24:33,346
Forensics went over all the footage,

338
00:24:33,430 --> 00:24:35,682
so why was there no mention made
of this shot?

339
00:24:36,183 --> 00:24:38,602
Unless you had
the memory chip inserted,

340
00:24:38,685 --> 00:24:41,021
you'd never notice something so brief.

341
00:24:41,104 --> 00:24:45,525
My husband caught sight of this silhouette
and was able to analyze it

342
00:24:45,609 --> 00:24:47,986
during the fraction of a second
it was in view.

343
00:24:48,069 --> 00:24:49,613
It can't be a human.

344
00:24:49,696 --> 00:24:52,282
Not the way it's jumping
from one building to another.

345
00:24:52,365 --> 00:24:55,035
Yes. But, Detective...

346
00:24:55,535 --> 00:24:56,536
Huh?

347
00:24:57,037 --> 00:24:58,914
...that's not a robot.

348
00:25:12,969 --> 00:25:16,848
<i>A murder in a room
with no trace of a human assailant.</i>

349
00:25:18,225 --> 00:25:21,186
<i>The death of a robot,
loved the world over.</i>

350
00:25:23,021 --> 00:25:24,689
<i>And horns.</i>

351
00:25:42,541 --> 00:25:44,668
<i>Identity confirmed.</i>

352
00:25:44,751 --> 00:25:46,169
<i>Please step forward.</i>

353
00:26:16,783 --> 00:26:19,703
Says you're a robot.
That true or what, Detective?

354
00:26:19,786 --> 00:26:20,620
Yes.

355
00:26:20,704 --> 00:26:23,164
Well, you could've fooled me
with that face.

356
00:26:25,750 --> 00:26:28,336
The electromagnetic waves he emits
are pretty strong.

357
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:31,089
They could scramble your AI
if you get too close to him.

358
00:26:31,172 --> 00:26:33,383
Wear this to keep you safe.

359
00:26:33,466 --> 00:26:34,759
I'm okay, thanks.

360
00:26:34,843 --> 00:26:37,429
I'm immune. They have no effect on me.

361
00:26:37,512 --> 00:26:38,346
Really?

362
00:26:38,430 --> 00:26:41,224
A very special alloy
was used in my construction.

363
00:26:41,308 --> 00:26:42,588
I'm plain on the outside though.

364
00:26:43,143 --> 00:26:46,938
All right. Your call, sir,
but stay on your guard.

365
00:26:48,398 --> 00:26:49,899
In the time he's been here,

366
00:26:49,983 --> 00:26:53,194
he's taken out four robots
who tried to engage with him.

367
00:27:15,383 --> 00:27:17,010
Like the barricade?

368
00:27:17,093 --> 00:27:19,763
It would be funny
if it weren't so desperate.

369
00:27:20,347 --> 00:27:21,681
They fear me.

370
00:27:21,765 --> 00:27:24,100
The humans threw together
that pile of junk

371
00:27:24,184 --> 00:27:27,228
so they can pretend
they're not quaking in their boots.

372
00:27:32,484 --> 00:27:35,362
So you're Brau1589.

373
00:27:42,994 --> 00:27:48,875
Robot Model HRS0288,
Inspector Gesicht.

374
00:27:48,958 --> 00:27:52,629
In terms of detective AI,
you're the best there is.

375
00:27:52,712 --> 00:27:55,840
If you can discern my model,
your ID function still works.

376
00:27:55,924 --> 00:27:58,009
Ah, you're sleuthing already.

377
00:27:58,093 --> 00:28:01,346
If anything,
it's more powerful than before.

378
00:28:01,429 --> 00:28:04,265
Locked away
and smashed half to hell as I am,

379
00:28:04,349 --> 00:28:08,812
I can't help but be curious
about what's happening in the world above.

380
00:28:09,521 --> 00:28:12,524
I came here today because
there's something I needed to ask you.

381
00:28:12,607 --> 00:28:14,025
Let me guess.

382
00:28:14,109 --> 00:28:16,486
What went through the mind
of a certain robot

383
00:28:16,569 --> 00:28:20,073
when it murdered a human
eight years ago, right?

384
00:28:23,118 --> 00:28:26,705
Robot rights scholar
Bernard Lanke was killed at home.

385
00:28:27,205 --> 00:28:28,456
I scanned the murder scene,

386
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:31,209
but there were no traces
of another human there.

387
00:28:31,835 --> 00:28:34,087
So was the killer a human, or was it...

388
00:28:34,170 --> 00:28:35,839
Or was it a robot?

389
00:28:35,922 --> 00:28:38,925
And if it was a robot,
why'd it do such a thing?

390
00:28:39,592 --> 00:28:43,888
Just between us,
the humans examined every last bit of it.

391
00:28:43,972 --> 00:28:47,475
My murderous artificial intelligence
that is.

392
00:28:47,559 --> 00:28:50,687
They were so sure
that a defect was to blame.

393
00:28:50,770 --> 00:28:51,813
But, no.

394
00:28:51,896 --> 00:28:54,357
They couldn't find
a single thing wrong with me.

395
00:28:54,441 --> 00:28:59,320
My AI passed the tests with flying colors.
No flaw in sight.

396
00:29:01,364 --> 00:29:05,577
Can you imagine how terrified
the humans were when they found that out?

397
00:29:05,660 --> 00:29:09,998
That's why they keep me locked away
down here, skewered and broken.

398
00:29:10,081 --> 00:29:12,751
If they're that afraid,
they should just pull out this spear.

399
00:29:12,834 --> 00:29:14,335
That would kill me dead.

400
00:29:14,419 --> 00:29:18,506
But, alas, my human captors
are too spineless even for that.

401
00:29:22,302 --> 00:29:25,263
Inspector Gesicht, if you want to peek

402
00:29:25,346 --> 00:29:27,515
into the head of a robot
who's committed murder,

403
00:29:27,599 --> 00:29:31,269
all you have to do is
exchange memory chips with me.

404
00:29:31,352 --> 00:29:34,731
Who knows?
You might learn all sorts of things.

405
00:29:45,325 --> 00:29:48,244
Those are some printed images
of Mont Blanc's destruction

406
00:29:48,328 --> 00:29:49,996
and the Lanke murder scene.

407
00:29:50,747 --> 00:29:53,708
The horns in both of them.
What could they mean?

408
00:29:54,793 --> 00:29:57,337
The ancient gods of Europe
come to mind.

409
00:29:57,837 --> 00:30:01,424
The god of death. He had horns like these.

410
00:30:01,508 --> 00:30:05,261
There was Herne the Hunter,
who took the souls of warriors.

411
00:30:05,345 --> 00:30:07,847
He was called the "Horned King."

412
00:30:07,931 --> 00:30:09,098
In Greek mythology,

413
00:30:09,182 --> 00:30:12,727
the horned king of the underworld
was Hades, of course.

414
00:30:12,811 --> 00:30:15,396
The Roman god of the dead

415
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:17,607
was Pluto.

416
00:30:19,609 --> 00:30:20,902
A god of the dead.

417
00:30:22,028 --> 00:30:25,281
Whoever did this,
they will strike again.

418
00:30:26,241 --> 00:30:29,619
Mont Blanc, one of
the most advanced robots on earth,

419
00:30:29,702 --> 00:30:32,831
was ripped apart
like he was a children's toy.

420
00:30:32,914 --> 00:30:36,251
Come on, Detective.
Do I need to spell it out for you?

421
00:30:36,334 --> 00:30:38,753
A handful of robots were created

422
00:30:38,837 --> 00:30:42,173
with the best technologies
the world had to offer.

423
00:30:42,257 --> 00:30:46,052
Robots who can also be
weapons of mass destruction.

424
00:30:46,553 --> 00:30:50,682
You already know who else is
in the crosshairs, do you not?

425
00:30:50,765 --> 00:30:54,644
There are six of them left,
present company included.

426
00:31:55,455 --> 00:31:56,873
I am trying to work.

427
00:31:56,956 --> 00:31:59,709
Don't just stand there in silence
like a damn mannequin.

428
00:32:00,877 --> 00:32:03,379
Sorry to have entered
without your permission.

429
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:05,965
The security seems to have been disabled.

430
00:32:06,049 --> 00:32:07,675
Mm-hmm.

431
00:32:07,759 --> 00:32:11,387
Given your visual impairment,
that is not safe.

432
00:32:11,471 --> 00:32:15,767
No burglar's going to tromp out
to the middle of nowhere to steal from me.

433
00:32:15,850 --> 00:32:19,646
- But Sir Duncan, you...
- Enough. Are you the new butler?

434
00:32:20,229 --> 00:32:21,229
Yes, sir.

435
00:32:21,272 --> 00:32:25,109
{\an8}I'm sure the agency sent me over
another good-for-nothing.

436
00:32:25,193 --> 00:32:26,193
{\an8}You got a name?

437
00:32:26,235 --> 00:32:29,656
Yes, sir.
You can refer to me as North No.2.

438
00:32:30,198 --> 00:32:32,867
{\an8}Direction and a number. Riveting.

439
00:32:34,744 --> 00:32:38,247
The staffing agency told me
you have a military background.

440
00:32:38,331 --> 00:32:40,792
Do you care to elaborate on that?

441
00:32:40,875 --> 00:32:43,586
Yes, sir.
I previously served as a butler

442
00:32:43,670 --> 00:32:45,630
for the Commander-in-Chief
of the British Army

443
00:32:45,713 --> 00:32:48,549
for the entirety
of the 39th Central Asian War.

444
00:32:48,633 --> 00:32:50,927
Hmm. Butler for a soldier, eh?

445
00:32:51,552 --> 00:32:54,222
I don't imagine
you're much to look at, are you?

446
00:32:54,722 --> 00:32:57,725
I wear a cape
while in the presence of others.

447
00:32:57,809 --> 00:33:01,521
But of course.
Your whole damn body's a weapon.

448
00:33:02,271 --> 00:33:04,983
- Make me tea, weapon.
- At once, sir.

449
00:33:05,650 --> 00:33:07,235
As for the type...

450
00:33:07,318 --> 00:33:08,653
Don't worry, sir.

451
00:33:08,736 --> 00:33:11,948
I made sure to download
all of your relevant data en route.

452
00:33:14,784 --> 00:33:18,413
What the hell's my "relevant data"?

453
00:33:19,747 --> 00:33:21,332
Prior to this assignment,

454
00:33:21,416 --> 00:33:24,293
I had the chance
to watch one of the films you worked on.

455
00:33:24,919 --> 00:33:27,922
It was the movie
<i>The Queen on the Satellite Orbit,</i>

456
00:33:28,006 --> 00:33:29,048
and I was very moved

457
00:33:29,132 --> 00:33:32,552
by how the soundtrack served
to uplift the imagery.

458
00:33:32,635 --> 00:33:34,971
Is that part of your "relevant data"?

459
00:33:35,054 --> 00:33:37,807
No, sir. I was sincerely moved by it.

460
00:33:37,890 --> 00:33:41,060
That film has been out
for more than a decade now.

461
00:33:41,644 --> 00:33:42,770
Your tea.

462
00:33:43,813 --> 00:33:45,773
Used to call me the "blind genius"

463
00:33:45,857 --> 00:33:48,860
back when I was stacking up film awards
like cordwood.

464
00:33:48,943 --> 00:33:50,778
Every score I composed was a hit.

465
00:33:50,862 --> 00:33:53,281
I'm sure you have the more recent reviews

466
00:33:53,364 --> 00:33:56,159
rattling around
in that metal skull of yours.

467
00:33:56,826 --> 00:34:00,288
"The wellspring of Paul Duncan's talent
has run dry."

468
00:34:00,830 --> 00:34:01,914
End quote.

469
00:34:02,415 --> 00:34:03,708
The hell it has.

470
00:34:03,791 --> 00:34:07,587
I could still compose circles
around anyone if I had a mind to.

471
00:34:07,670 --> 00:34:09,922
How dare they just write me off?

472
00:34:10,006 --> 00:34:13,176
They would be on their feet,
applauding at my simplest leitmotif,

473
00:34:13,259 --> 00:34:16,929
then I'd squeeze their heart with my notes
and leave them in tears.

474
00:34:17,013 --> 00:34:20,266
It's not that I can't compose.
It's that I refuse to.

475
00:34:20,349 --> 00:34:23,144
Such trivial things hold no appeal for me.

476
00:34:23,227 --> 00:34:26,355
But, sir,
you were at the piano just now.

477
00:34:26,439 --> 00:34:29,067
It was a beautiful piece,
if I may be so bold.

478
00:34:30,401 --> 00:34:32,779
That one's not meant
for the celluloid brothel.

479
00:34:32,862 --> 00:34:37,116
It's a song I write only for myself.
The world can't lay claim to any of it.

480
00:34:41,537 --> 00:34:44,248
- This cup of tea is much like your name.
- Sir?

481
00:34:44,332 --> 00:34:46,709
Utterly lacking flavor.

482
00:34:46,793 --> 00:34:50,338
"A beautiful piece," eh?
Don't make me laugh.

483
00:34:50,421 --> 00:34:55,676
A hunk of military hardware like you has
no right to judge the value of my art.

484
00:34:57,512 --> 00:34:59,138
My apologies, sir.

485
00:35:31,838 --> 00:35:33,589
How many did you kill?

486
00:35:33,673 --> 00:35:34,673
Sir?

487
00:35:35,133 --> 00:35:38,386
How many people did you kill
in the Central Asian War?

488
00:35:38,469 --> 00:35:40,596
I'm sure you can give me an exact number.

489
00:35:41,597 --> 00:35:46,269
The International Robot Laws forbid me
from harming any humans. I am incapable.

490
00:35:46,978 --> 00:35:49,730
So then, killed lots of robots,
in other words.

491
00:35:51,190 --> 00:35:53,025
What does that number come out to?

492
00:35:55,069 --> 00:35:57,280
Don't pretend as though you've lost count.

493
00:35:59,532 --> 00:36:00,575
Get out of here.

494
00:36:01,659 --> 00:36:04,954
Your demeanor's ruining
what little appetite I have.

495
00:36:05,746 --> 00:36:07,206
I will take my leave.

496
00:36:33,441 --> 00:36:36,986
What are you doing?
You leave my piano alone, you hear me?

497
00:36:38,529 --> 00:36:40,114
My apologies, sir.

498
00:36:41,032 --> 00:36:42,366
When composing music,

499
00:36:42,450 --> 00:36:44,952
this instrument
is the only one you employ.

500
00:36:45,036 --> 00:36:46,746
Yes. What of it?

501
00:36:46,829 --> 00:36:50,416
But you have so much
cutting-edge equipment at your disposal.

502
00:36:51,792 --> 00:36:54,003
They're cutting-edge fakeries,
just like you.

503
00:36:54,712 --> 00:36:57,506
A fake violin right there
next to a fake trumpet.

504
00:36:58,090 --> 00:37:00,426
The whole damn orchestra, fake.

505
00:37:00,509 --> 00:37:04,222
Oh, dress 'em up all you want.
They're nothing more than machines.

506
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:06,724
No, thank you.

507
00:37:06,807 --> 00:37:09,268
That's why I never had
artificial eyes put in.

508
00:37:09,352 --> 00:37:12,313
If I need a machine
to tell me what the world looks like,

509
00:37:12,396 --> 00:37:14,190
then I'd rather not see at all.

510
00:37:14,273 --> 00:37:16,025
Far better to live in the dark.

511
00:37:16,108 --> 00:37:20,488
{\an8}The only sights worth laying eyes on
already exist within my memory.

512
00:37:21,697 --> 00:37:23,950
"The sights worth laying eyes on."

513
00:37:24,617 --> 00:37:28,454
Visions of my childhood home
back when I still had my sight.

514
00:37:28,537 --> 00:37:31,624
During your youth, sir,
back in Bohemia.

515
00:37:32,250 --> 00:37:34,418
That another tidbit from your data?

516
00:37:34,502 --> 00:37:38,256
It's all worthless when it's just a list
within your processors.

517
00:37:38,798 --> 00:37:41,008
It was such a beautiful milieu.

518
00:37:41,509 --> 00:37:44,095
{\an8}The fields run riot with green.

519
00:37:44,595 --> 00:37:46,389
{\an8}The wind's caress.

520
00:37:46,472 --> 00:37:51,394
{\an8}And always the glow
of the gently setting sun.

521
00:37:54,230 --> 00:37:57,733
<i>I will turn them into music.
I must.</i>

522
00:39:13,642 --> 00:39:16,729
I told you not to touch my piano,
you great clod!

523
00:39:17,730 --> 00:39:19,774
Yes, you have my apologies.

524
00:39:20,608 --> 00:39:22,610
Even if you played a song to perfection,

525
00:39:22,693 --> 00:39:26,113
the notes and chords
would all be as artificial as you are.

526
00:39:27,114 --> 00:39:27,990
Sir Duncan.

527
00:39:28,074 --> 00:39:30,993
I do not mean to intrude
upon your privacy, sir,

528
00:39:31,077 --> 00:39:34,330
but I happened to notice that
you were moaning in your sleep last night.

529
00:39:34,413 --> 00:39:35,498
{\an8}Hmm?

530
00:39:35,581 --> 00:39:38,042
{\an8}However,
it sounded like you were humming

531
00:39:38,125 --> 00:39:39,710
{\an8}amidst the moans as well.

532
00:39:40,878 --> 00:39:42,004
I could be mistaken,

533
00:39:42,088 --> 00:39:45,007
but I think that melody,
born of your unconscious mind,

534
00:39:45,091 --> 00:39:48,260
is the missing portion of the song
you currently struggle to finish.

535
00:39:48,344 --> 00:39:51,347
It's the section where
you always stop midway.

536
00:39:53,307 --> 00:39:56,685
This is how it went, sir. More or less.

537
00:39:59,188 --> 00:40:00,689
Get out of here!

538
00:40:00,773 --> 00:40:03,901
{\an8}I have no need for you,
you piece of machinery!

539
00:40:03,984 --> 00:40:05,820
{\an8}Get out of my house this instant!

540
00:40:05,903 --> 00:40:07,238
But, sir...

541
00:40:07,321 --> 00:40:10,408
I am giving you an order! Leave at once!

542
00:40:12,660 --> 00:40:13,702
Sir Duncan.

543
00:40:17,123 --> 00:40:20,167
I would like to learn to play the piano
if you will teach me.

544
00:40:20,751 --> 00:40:22,628
What did you say?

545
00:40:22,711 --> 00:40:25,089
As you have told me numerous times,

546
00:40:25,172 --> 00:40:28,592
no matter how well I play,
it might always ring false.

547
00:40:29,260 --> 00:40:33,097
But I'd like to know
I got as close as I could.

548
00:40:33,180 --> 00:40:37,059
A weapon like you will never
play the piano, and that's final.

549
00:40:46,485 --> 00:40:47,403
Stop it!

550
00:40:47,486 --> 00:40:50,322
How dare you sully those keys,
you tool of war?

551
00:40:50,406 --> 00:40:53,409
{\an8}You belong on a battlefield,
and you know it!

552
00:40:54,660 --> 00:40:55,828
You are right.

553
00:40:57,913 --> 00:41:00,791
{\an8}That is why I'd like to learn
to play the piano.

554
00:41:01,917 --> 00:41:05,754
I do not want
to belong on the battlefield.

555
00:41:09,925 --> 00:41:11,677
Mother!

556
00:41:12,470 --> 00:41:13,637
Mother!

557
00:41:15,681 --> 00:41:18,058
No, please!

558
00:41:18,142 --> 00:41:19,310
Where are you?

559
00:41:25,065 --> 00:41:27,151
Wait for me!

560
00:41:29,904 --> 00:41:31,280
Whoa!

561
00:41:31,363 --> 00:41:34,283
Mother, don't leave me behind!
I'm right here!

562
00:41:35,951 --> 00:41:38,162
Mother!

563
00:41:39,413 --> 00:41:41,123
<i>Mother!</i>

564
00:41:46,170 --> 00:41:49,131
Are you there, North No.2?
I think that you are.

565
00:41:51,675 --> 00:41:55,054
I've told you before,
don't come into my bedroom.

566
00:41:55,137 --> 00:41:57,014
I apologize, Sir Duncan.

567
00:41:57,097 --> 00:41:59,850
I merely wanted to inform you
that breakfast is ready.

568
00:42:03,312 --> 00:42:05,272
I could've sworn I fired you.

569
00:42:08,150 --> 00:42:09,401
Are you still there?

570
00:42:19,286 --> 00:42:21,664
How many times must I say it?

571
00:42:24,500 --> 00:42:26,919
Don't you touch that piano! Not ever!

572
00:42:27,002 --> 00:42:29,922
Let me play for you. Please, Sir Duncan.

573
00:42:30,005 --> 00:42:32,383
I think I've gotten
a little better than before.

574
00:42:32,466 --> 00:42:34,552
"Gotten a little better," eh?

575
00:42:34,635 --> 00:42:39,265
The only improvement you can hope for is
if you turn yourself into a metronome!

576
00:42:40,224 --> 00:42:41,976
I will attempt to recreate the melody

577
00:42:42,059 --> 00:42:44,395
you keep humming in your sleep,
Sir Duncan.

578
00:43:00,494 --> 00:43:04,331
The sounds you torture
out of that piano are not music!

579
00:43:07,084 --> 00:43:08,502
Damn this piece of junk!

580
00:43:09,295 --> 00:43:11,088
"Just input the data,

581
00:43:11,171 --> 00:43:14,675
and you can create infinite melodies
with the push of a button!"

582
00:43:17,636 --> 00:43:21,265
That's not music at all!
It's just sounds with no heart to it!

583
00:43:22,057 --> 00:43:24,351
You will break the machines
if you continue.

584
00:43:25,102 --> 00:43:28,230
Oh! Trying to protect
your own kind, is that it?

585
00:43:29,064 --> 00:43:30,399
I'll ask again.

586
00:43:30,482 --> 00:43:34,236
How many of your own kind
did you destroy on the battlefield?

587
00:43:35,821 --> 00:43:38,198
Take off the cape,
you cast-iron hypocrite!

588
00:43:38,282 --> 00:43:40,701
Show the world
your hideous weapon of a body!

589
00:43:40,784 --> 00:43:43,621
How many did you kill? Give me the number!

590
00:43:43,704 --> 00:43:46,123
How many notches carved into your side?

591
00:43:46,206 --> 00:43:48,876
Ha! You're a docile one, aren't you?

592
00:43:48,959 --> 00:43:50,711
A weapon of mass destruction

593
00:43:50,794 --> 00:43:54,548
programmed to behave
in front of his master, is that it?

594
00:43:56,008 --> 00:43:57,301
All right, then.

595
00:43:57,384 --> 00:43:59,386
I'm going to give you some data about me

596
00:43:59,470 --> 00:44:02,723
that I guarantee isn't rolling around
in that head of yours.

597
00:44:02,806 --> 00:44:06,018
It's the reason I moan in my sleep
in the dead of night.

598
00:44:06,602 --> 00:44:08,979
The nightmare I've had for years now.

599
00:44:10,064 --> 00:44:12,983
{\an8}Not a dream,
but the life that brought me to this.

600
00:44:13,067 --> 00:44:14,610
{\an8}Truth from long ago.

601
00:44:16,904 --> 00:44:19,531
<i>The world knows me
as Paul Duncan,</i>

602
00:44:19,615 --> 00:44:22,242
<i>but my real name is Paulo Holy.</i>

603
00:44:22,326 --> 00:44:25,162
<i>I was born into poverty in Bohemia.</i>

604
00:44:25,954 --> 00:44:27,665
<i>I can't remember my father.</i>

605
00:44:27,748 --> 00:44:29,667
<i>He died when I was young.</i>

606
00:44:29,750 --> 00:44:31,752
<i>I was born with a chronic illness.</i>

607
00:44:31,835 --> 00:44:35,839
<i>And even with thick glasses,
my eyesight was always poor.</i>

608
00:44:35,923 --> 00:44:38,634
<i>Singing songs was my only joy in life.</i>

609
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:42,137
<i>My mother, she was a beauty.</i>

610
00:44:42,221 --> 00:44:43,681
<i>Even at her most threadbare,</i>

611
00:44:43,764 --> 00:44:47,101
<i>men would turn
and watch her walk down the street.</i>

612
00:44:47,726 --> 00:44:51,647
<i>One approached her.
He was a member of the nouveau-riche.</i>

613
00:44:52,398 --> 00:44:54,942
<i>And she, my mother,</i>

614
00:44:55,025 --> 00:44:58,278
<i>fell prey to a greed
that poisoned her heart.</i>

615
00:45:00,239 --> 00:45:01,365
Sick as I was,

616
00:45:01,448 --> 00:45:03,534
she must have thought me such a burden.

617
00:45:03,617 --> 00:45:05,577
Looking back, that has to be the reason

618
00:45:05,661 --> 00:45:07,246
why she did what she did.

619
00:45:08,330 --> 00:45:11,083
The reason why
she threw her own child away!

620
00:45:12,418 --> 00:45:16,964
<i>Out of nowhere, I was shipped off
to a boarding school in England.</i>

621
00:45:17,631 --> 00:45:19,258
<i>The other boys were cruel,</i>

622
00:45:19,758 --> 00:45:23,637
<i>and a weakling such as myself
was in no place to fight back.</i>

623
00:45:24,138 --> 00:45:25,597
<i>But through the worst of it,</i>

624
00:45:25,681 --> 00:45:29,560
<i>I clung to my music studies
like a drowning man.</i>

625
00:45:30,352 --> 00:45:32,521
<i>The long nights came at a price.</i>

626
00:45:32,604 --> 00:45:35,482
<i>I soon developed a fever I couldn't shake.</i>

627
00:45:35,566 --> 00:45:38,777
<i>Even my beloved music
slipped from my grasp.</i>

628
00:45:46,910 --> 00:45:50,414
<i>I was sent from hospital ward
to hospital ward,</i>

629
00:45:50,497 --> 00:45:53,083
<i>but every day saw me grow weaker.</i>

630
00:45:54,042 --> 00:45:55,878
<i>The doctors gave up on me.</i>

631
00:45:55,961 --> 00:45:58,630
<i>And through it all,
not a peep from my mother.</i>

632
00:46:00,591 --> 00:46:04,553
<i>I was dying. They knew it, and I did too.</i>

633
00:46:05,095 --> 00:46:07,890
<i>I would perish far from home,</i>

634
00:46:07,973 --> 00:46:09,975
<i>forgotten and forlorn.</i>

635
00:46:12,019 --> 00:46:15,397
<i>And that's when
a Japanese doctor walked into my room.</i>

636
00:46:15,481 --> 00:46:19,693
<i>He didn't have a license,
but lost causes were his specialty.</i>

637
00:46:21,028 --> 00:46:23,530
I'm going to save your life,
young man.

638
00:46:24,490 --> 00:46:28,410
But there's a chance
that you go blind in the bargain.

639
00:46:32,289 --> 00:46:34,291
<i>The surgery was a success.</i>

640
00:46:35,375 --> 00:46:39,421
<i>And yet,
just as the rogue doctor had predicted,</i>

641
00:46:39,505 --> 00:46:42,257
<i>my eyes grew weaker with each passing day.</i>

642
00:46:42,341 --> 00:46:44,176
<i>I knew time was running out,</i>

643
00:46:44,259 --> 00:46:47,095
<i>and there was
so much theory left to learn.</i>

644
00:46:47,179 --> 00:46:49,515
<i>I forsook everything but the music.</i>

645
00:46:50,224 --> 00:46:52,768
<i>Music was all I had left in the world.</i>

646
00:46:53,685 --> 00:46:56,063
<i>Play it again! Quickly, now!</i>

647
00:46:56,772 --> 00:47:00,567
<i>Not yet! Not yet! Not yet!</i>

648
00:47:04,363 --> 00:47:05,364
<i>And then,</i>

649
00:47:06,031 --> 00:47:08,283
<i>the darkness was complete.</i>

650
00:47:10,452 --> 00:47:13,789
A few years later,
I was told my mother had died.

651
00:47:14,289 --> 00:47:18,418
Her wealthy suitor never did bother
to make an honest woman out of her.

652
00:47:18,502 --> 00:47:21,797
They told me she was alone
when the end came.

653
00:47:21,880 --> 00:47:24,091
Abandoned, as I had been.

654
00:47:24,925 --> 00:47:26,385
I worked hard!

655
00:47:26,468 --> 00:47:30,430
When his fortunes fell,
I bought her lover's castle. All of this!

656
00:47:30,514 --> 00:47:33,976
Paulo Holy had become
the genius Paul Duncan.

657
00:47:34,560 --> 00:47:39,147
I became maestro of the music world
and took this as my reward!

658
00:47:40,190 --> 00:47:41,316
Look, Mother!

659
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:44,319
This is what you wanted, right?
All this comfort and wealth.

660
00:47:45,070 --> 00:47:47,823
You threw your child away
for the chance to have it!

661
00:47:47,906 --> 00:47:49,324
Well, here it is!

662
00:47:50,742 --> 00:47:52,286
I prevailed!

663
00:47:52,369 --> 00:47:56,248
And now, Mother, I'm going to pay homage
to all the riches you squandered.

664
00:47:56,331 --> 00:47:59,251
The beautiful hues
of the homeland you deserted!

665
00:47:59,334 --> 00:48:02,212
<i>I will take those sights
that live in my memory</i>

666
00:48:02,296 --> 00:48:03,714
<i>and paint them into song.</i>

667
00:48:03,797 --> 00:48:07,426
{\an8}I will show you priceless things
that never should have been cast aside,

668
00:48:07,509 --> 00:48:09,219
and you will know your mistake!

669
00:48:13,515 --> 00:48:16,810
Sir Duncan,
your anger towards your mother is...

670
00:48:16,894 --> 00:48:17,936
Silence!

671
00:48:21,023 --> 00:48:24,526
I'll give you high marks,
but you leave here tomorrow.

672
00:48:56,016 --> 00:48:58,894
<i>That is why
I'd like to learn to play the piano.</i>

673
00:48:59,394 --> 00:49:03,357
<i>I do not want
to belong on the battlefield.</i>

674
00:50:04,042 --> 00:50:06,712
I guess
he did get a little bit better.

675
00:50:24,104 --> 00:50:25,105
Hmm?

676
00:50:31,695 --> 00:50:35,574
Charging his power supply
before he leaves in the morning, eh?

677
00:50:36,283 --> 00:50:37,951
Just like a machine.

678
00:50:51,423 --> 00:50:53,550
Is the robot having a nightmare?

679
00:51:00,098 --> 00:51:04,019
So they can dream.
I didn't know that about you.

680
00:51:32,172 --> 00:51:36,718
"It's not that I can't compose anymore.
It's that I refuse." Yeah.

681
00:51:39,596 --> 00:51:40,596
Hey!

682
00:51:42,307 --> 00:51:43,683
North No.2.

683
00:51:45,102 --> 00:51:47,312
North No.2! Hey!

684
00:51:50,482 --> 00:51:52,984
Mmm, sounds like he really left this time.

685
00:51:58,907 --> 00:52:01,493
Maybe I can't compose anymore.

686
00:52:18,301 --> 00:52:20,679
How long are you going
to make me wait for him, eh?

687
00:52:20,762 --> 00:52:23,056
When is the replacement butler
going to be here?

688
00:52:23,140 --> 00:52:25,976
<i>Uh, this is Marshall
calling from MCM Pictures.</i>

689
00:52:26,518 --> 00:52:28,520
So you're just a movie guy.

690
00:52:28,603 --> 00:52:31,481
<i>You sound a bit disappointed, Sir Duncan.
Something wrong?</i>

691
00:52:31,565 --> 00:52:36,027
No, I just had to fire my butler robot
the other day, that's all.

692
00:52:36,945 --> 00:52:38,363
Well, get on with it, then.

693
00:52:38,446 --> 00:52:42,784
<i>Yes, sir. I'm calling because we'd love
to have your work in an upcoming film.</i>

694
00:52:42,868 --> 00:52:45,203
Oh. Sounds like a job offer.

695
00:52:45,287 --> 00:52:48,832
Tell me what you have in mind,
and I'll decide if it's worth my energy.

696
00:52:49,416 --> 00:52:50,959
<i>That's very kind of you, sir.</i>

697
00:52:51,042 --> 00:52:53,837
<i>Basically, we would love to license
one of your old scores</i>

698
00:52:53,920 --> 00:52:55,130
<i>for use in this project.</i>

699
00:52:55,755 --> 00:52:58,425
What? Don't you want
to use a new soundtrack?

700
00:52:58,508 --> 00:53:03,555
<i>Oh! Uh, I was of the understanding
that you had retired from composing.</i>

701
00:53:06,474 --> 00:53:08,685
Use the damn thing any way you like.

702
00:53:08,768 --> 00:53:10,395
<i>Oh! Sir Duncan, I meant no...</i>

703
00:53:12,981 --> 00:53:15,108
<i>You have one new message.</i>

704
00:53:19,154 --> 00:53:23,158
<i>Uh, Russell here, from the Planning Office
at the British Philharmonic Orchestra.</i>

705
00:53:23,700 --> 00:53:27,996
<i>We'd been in talks about perhaps mounting
one of your works for our upcoming season.</i>

706
00:53:28,580 --> 00:53:32,042
<i>Unfortunately, we're not in a position
to follow up on that.</i>

707
00:53:32,542 --> 00:53:34,127
<i>You have my apologies.</i>

708
00:53:34,211 --> 00:53:36,338
<i>I hope we get to collaborate
in the future.</i>

709
00:53:57,692 --> 00:53:59,319
<i>I think that melody</i>

710
00:54:00,153 --> 00:54:03,907
<i>is the missing portion of the song
you currently struggle to finish.</i>

711
00:55:52,557 --> 00:55:53,767
Sir Duncan.

712
00:55:54,976 --> 00:55:57,354
I thought you'd want to know
that I am back.

713
00:55:59,230 --> 00:56:00,357
Now what?

714
00:56:00,440 --> 00:56:02,317
Didn't I tell you to get out of here?

715
00:56:03,026 --> 00:56:05,278
I did leave, as you requested.

716
00:56:05,362 --> 00:56:07,364
I went to your hometown in Bohemia.

717
00:56:08,198 --> 00:56:10,658
What could have possessed you
to make that trip?

718
00:56:10,742 --> 00:56:13,286
My purpose there was to archive old music.

719
00:56:14,454 --> 00:56:17,791
In the process of collecting
many folk songs from the region,

720
00:56:18,875 --> 00:56:20,210
I was able to find it.

721
00:56:20,794 --> 00:56:23,338
The melody you continue to hum
when you are asleep.

722
00:56:23,421 --> 00:56:24,881
I know how it goes.

723
00:56:26,341 --> 00:56:28,259
Please allow me to sing it for you.

724
00:56:28,343 --> 00:56:31,805
No, damn it!
Singing should be for real people only!

725
00:56:32,305 --> 00:56:35,517
Why would you try to drag
my nightmare out into the light of day?

726
00:56:35,600 --> 00:56:39,521
We don't remember everything
like you machines, and that is a blessing!

727
00:56:40,647 --> 00:56:43,650
Your dream is not a nightmare, sir.
You deserve to know that.

728
00:56:46,194 --> 00:56:50,198
To lose the dreams I have at night
would be a mercy, but yours is different.

729
00:56:52,117 --> 00:56:55,620
Just as you said,
I am nothing more than a weapon.

730
00:56:56,329 --> 00:56:59,707
During my time
in the 39th Central Asian War,

731
00:56:59,791 --> 00:57:02,001
I neutralized many of the foe's units.

732
00:57:02,752 --> 00:57:03,752
No,

733
00:57:04,337 --> 00:57:05,880
I decimated them.

734
00:57:06,381 --> 00:57:08,466
Tens of thousands of my own kind.

735
00:57:09,300 --> 00:57:11,010
And those memories,

736
00:57:11,094 --> 00:57:13,930
the memories of
the countless deaths by my hand,

737
00:57:14,013 --> 00:57:17,684
my artificial intelligence
plays them back again and again.

738
00:57:19,644 --> 00:57:22,897
While in Bohemia, I met an ancient man.

739
00:57:24,065 --> 00:57:26,901
He had a wealth of knowledge
about folk songs,

740
00:57:26,985 --> 00:57:28,987
including the song in your dream.

741
00:57:29,737 --> 00:57:33,199
He said that this one young woman
in particular

742
00:57:33,283 --> 00:57:36,578
used to sing it so beautifully,
he remembers even now.

743
00:57:38,246 --> 00:57:40,081
That young woman was your mother.

744
00:57:42,417 --> 00:57:44,961
I have so much data in my mind about you.

745
00:57:45,670 --> 00:57:48,673
It includes facts about your mother
you never got to know.

746
00:57:49,424 --> 00:57:50,925
It felt that way,

747
00:57:51,009 --> 00:57:53,470
but as your chronic illness
grew more pronounced,

748
00:57:53,553 --> 00:57:55,138
she did not abandon you.

749
00:57:55,638 --> 00:57:59,058
The rich man you hated
for stealing her affections,

750
00:57:59,142 --> 00:58:03,021
she sought him out in order to fund
the treatment that saved your life.

751
00:58:03,730 --> 00:58:04,730
It's true.

752
00:58:05,148 --> 00:58:08,735
The rogue doctor who operated on you
charged an astronomical fee,

753
00:58:08,818 --> 00:58:11,112
and that was the only way
she could afford it.

754
00:58:12,572 --> 00:58:15,575
She did not throw you away
when she sent you abroad.

755
00:58:15,658 --> 00:58:18,578
In the weeks and months,
as your vision slowly dimmed,

756
00:58:19,412 --> 00:58:21,748
your mother was never far, Sir Duncan.

757
00:58:22,499 --> 00:58:26,628
Learning how much you hated her,
she couldn't bring herself to reach out.

758
00:58:26,711 --> 00:58:29,881
The divide she would have had
to repair seemed too great.

759
00:58:30,381 --> 00:58:32,008
Uh, she was there?

760
00:58:34,135 --> 00:58:36,763
{\an8}- That can't be.
- It's the truth.

761
00:58:37,347 --> 00:58:39,933
When you recall your childhood in Bohemia,

762
00:58:40,016 --> 00:58:42,936
isn't there a core memory
that you've forgotten about?

763
00:58:45,480 --> 00:58:47,482
The ancient villager remembered.

764
00:58:48,608 --> 00:58:51,945
You and your mother would sing
that old folk song together

765
00:58:52,529 --> 00:58:55,156
hand-in-hand until the very last note

766
00:58:55,240 --> 00:58:58,368
as the setting sun
turned the fields into gold.

767
00:59:38,992 --> 00:59:40,118
<i>Mother.</i>

768
00:59:46,666 --> 00:59:48,876
How can I forget?

769
00:59:51,963 --> 00:59:53,339
I apologize, sir,

770
00:59:54,132 --> 00:59:55,466
for how I sang it.

771
00:59:58,344 --> 01:00:01,264
You deserve to remember
all the pieces of your dream

772
01:00:02,724 --> 01:00:04,934
as I deserve to remember mine.

773
01:00:09,272 --> 01:00:10,565
North No.2?

774
01:00:12,817 --> 01:00:14,485
I want you to stay.

775
01:00:14,569 --> 01:00:17,196
Don't you ever go back to the battlefield.

776
01:00:22,660 --> 01:00:25,121
Would you like me to teach you the piano?

777
01:00:28,333 --> 01:00:29,333
Yes, sir.

778
01:02:31,247 --> 01:02:32,957
North No.2!

779
01:02:33,040 --> 01:02:35,334
Hey, North No.2!

780
01:02:35,835 --> 01:02:37,670
Yes, Sir Duncan. I am here.

781
01:02:38,337 --> 01:02:40,798
I've finally finished it!
Give it a listen!

782
01:02:41,591 --> 01:02:45,052
Yes, sir.
I would love to hear it in its entirety.

783
01:02:45,595 --> 01:02:48,389
- However...
- Hmm? What's the matter?

784
01:02:49,223 --> 01:02:52,351
I am picking up something approaching
at a high velocity.

785
01:02:52,435 --> 01:02:53,936
Uh, like what?

786
01:02:54,020 --> 01:02:57,565
Maybe one of your robot friends
finally decided to pay you a visit.

787
01:02:57,648 --> 01:03:00,902
There was an incident
up in the Alps a few days ago.

788
01:03:00,985 --> 01:03:02,528
Did you hear reports about it?

789
01:03:02,612 --> 01:03:04,781
Something up in the Alps?

790
01:03:04,864 --> 01:03:06,908
Oh, yes. I did catch a news segment

791
01:03:06,991 --> 01:03:10,578
on how that Mont Blanc robot
was destroyed by a tornado.

792
01:03:10,661 --> 01:03:11,661
What of it?

793
01:03:12,371 --> 01:03:17,210
Just now, sir, a tornado was reported
100 kilometers from our position.

794
01:03:17,293 --> 01:03:18,336
Hmm?

795
01:03:23,841 --> 01:03:26,803
An unknown assailant
is on a path of direct approach.

796
01:03:28,888 --> 01:03:30,640
Hey!

797
01:03:32,308 --> 01:03:33,976
I'll return very soon.

798
01:03:34,811 --> 01:03:36,562
Wait, North No.2!

799
01:04:08,594 --> 01:04:10,012
North No.2!

800
01:04:12,014 --> 01:04:13,391
Where did you go?

801
01:04:17,895 --> 01:04:19,146
Come back!

802
01:04:26,529 --> 01:04:29,407
That sound I heard just now...
What could it be?

803
01:04:35,413 --> 01:04:37,832
I can't tell what's going on up there!

804
01:04:45,423 --> 01:04:46,423
An explosion.

805
01:04:52,513 --> 01:04:54,724
Huh?

806
01:04:58,185 --> 01:04:59,270
I hear it.

807
01:05:07,361 --> 01:05:08,779
I hear him singing.

808
01:05:10,072 --> 01:05:15,244
I feel it spreading to fill the sky.

809
01:05:21,417 --> 01:05:23,586
I hear your voice, my boy.

810
01:05:28,674 --> 01:05:32,011
{\an8}You're singing our song
and with such feeling.

811
01:05:42,813 --> 01:05:45,316
Time to come back home, North No.2.

812
01:05:45,399 --> 01:05:47,735
I think that's enough singing for one day.

813
01:05:48,819 --> 01:05:50,363
Hurry on home now.

814
01:05:52,531 --> 01:05:55,284
You're going to be late
for piano practice.

815
01:06:21,018 --> 01:06:23,229
- It's super awesome!
- Really?

816
01:06:41,914 --> 01:06:43,833
Ah. Found a snail, did you?

817
01:06:44,583 --> 01:06:45,583
I did.

818
01:06:50,089 --> 01:06:51,757
It's very nice to meet you.

819
01:06:53,676 --> 01:06:55,970
I believe your name is Atom, right?

820
01:06:58,681 --> 01:06:59,681
Uh-huh.
