1
00:00:13,304 --> 00:00:14,806
<i>Root out the bugs!</i>

2
00:00:14,889 --> 00:00:17,475
<i>Sweep away all monsters and demons!</i>

3
00:00:22,647 --> 00:00:25,066
Yes! I am a counterrevolutionary!

4
00:00:25,150 --> 00:00:26,484
I beg you

5
00:00:26,568 --> 00:00:29,696
to rehabilitate me!

6
00:00:29,779 --> 00:00:34,409
<i>Strike down the counterrevolutionary!</i>

7
00:00:35,994 --> 00:00:37,829
Bring out the next one.

8
00:00:48,715 --> 00:00:49,841
Rebellion is just!

9
00:00:49,924 --> 00:00:51,009
Revolution is righteous!

10
00:00:51,092 --> 00:00:52,218
<i>Rebellion is just!</i>

11
00:00:52,302 --> 00:00:54,012
<i>Revolution is righteous!</i>

12
00:01:05,356 --> 00:01:08,359
Father...

13
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:10,153
Ye Zhetai.

14
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:15,617
Aren't you a professor of physics?

15
00:01:17,410 --> 00:01:19,954
You should know.

16
00:01:20,038 --> 00:01:21,915
You were my student.

17
00:01:22,123 --> 00:01:23,123
Behave yourself!

18
00:01:24,626 --> 00:01:25,752
Ye Zhetai.

19
00:01:25,835 --> 00:01:30,882
In your physics course,
did you teach the theory of relativity?

20
00:01:32,133 --> 00:01:35,178
Relativity is one
of the fundamental theories of physics.

21
00:01:35,512 --> 00:01:37,639
How can a basic survey course
not teach it?

22
00:01:37,722 --> 00:01:39,224
You lie!

23
00:01:39,307 --> 00:01:41,309
Einstein went to the American Imperialists

24
00:01:41,392 --> 00:01:43,686
and helped them build the atomic bomb!

25
00:01:48,775 --> 00:01:50,318
Bring up his wife!

26
00:01:50,401 --> 00:01:53,947
She is a genuine physicist!
She knows the truth!

27
00:01:56,699 --> 00:01:57,699
Mother!

28
00:02:07,836 --> 00:02:09,129
Ye Zhetai!

29
00:02:09,462 --> 00:02:11,840
With the help of the revolutionary youth,

30
00:02:11,923 --> 00:02:15,135
it has become clear to me.

31
00:02:15,218 --> 00:02:17,178
I want to stand on the side of the people!

32
00:02:21,349 --> 00:02:23,309
Bow your head, Ye Zhetai!

33
00:02:23,393 --> 00:02:24,727
Bow your head!

34
00:02:26,396 --> 00:02:27,438
Bow!

35
00:02:27,522 --> 00:02:30,567
Ye Zhetai. You cannot deny

36
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:34,487
you lectured on the
counterrevolutionary Big Bang theory.

37
00:02:35,155 --> 00:02:41,786
It is the most plausible explanation
for the origin of the universe.

38
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:43,246
Lies!

39
00:02:43,329 --> 00:02:46,583
The theory claims to know when time began.

40
00:02:46,666 --> 00:02:48,585
Time began?

41
00:02:49,669 --> 00:02:50,795
What came before time?

42
00:02:51,171 --> 00:02:55,300
It leaves open a place
to be filled by God.

43
00:02:58,636 --> 00:03:02,473
Are you suggesting God exists?

44
00:03:05,101 --> 00:03:10,273
Science has given no evidence either way.

45
00:03:13,193 --> 00:03:17,822
<i>Down with Ye Zhetai!</i>

46
00:03:18,114 --> 00:03:20,617
Down with academic authorities!

47
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:22,911
<i>Down with academic authorities!</i>

48
00:03:23,494 --> 00:03:24,787
Rebellion is just!

49
00:03:24,871 --> 00:03:25,955
<i>Revolution is righteous!</i>

50
00:04:28,518 --> 00:04:30,853
Let me go.

51
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:34,107
Let me go!

52
00:05:21,946 --> 00:05:24,073
Ye Wenjie.

53
00:07:12,265 --> 00:07:15,393
Scotland Yard have been helpful
for a change.

54
00:07:15,476 --> 00:07:17,353
I told them we need to be involved.

55
00:07:31,784 --> 00:07:34,745
Dr. Sadiq Mohammed. Born in Karachi.

56
00:07:34,829 --> 00:07:38,416
Studied cosmology
and theoretical physics at MIT.

57
00:07:39,709 --> 00:07:41,752
Strange suicide note.

58
00:07:42,753 --> 00:07:44,505
Another countdown.

59
00:07:50,011 --> 00:07:52,555
One of the betting sites
had him as a favorite

60
00:07:52,638 --> 00:07:54,974
for the next Nobel Prize in physics.

61
00:07:55,725 --> 00:07:56,726
You can bet on that?

62
00:07:57,477 --> 00:07:59,604
You can bet on anything, boss.

63
00:08:12,742 --> 00:08:14,118
History of mental illness,

64
00:08:14,202 --> 00:08:16,537
previous suicide attempts,
anything like that?

65
00:08:16,621 --> 00:08:19,207
Nothing. Just like the others.

66
00:08:34,388 --> 00:08:35,515
Christ.

67
00:09:14,929 --> 00:09:16,931
I knew you'd be the last one here.

68
00:09:18,015 --> 00:09:19,934
Here till the lights go out, boss.

69
00:09:21,978 --> 00:09:24,772
I keep thinking
if I just stare at the screen long enough,

70
00:09:25,565 --> 00:09:27,066
something will come to me.

71
00:09:27,692 --> 00:09:29,944
- They've shut the project down.
- Mm-hmm.

72
00:09:30,027 --> 00:09:32,238
But the power's on till midnight, so...

73
00:09:33,781 --> 00:09:36,242
You told us, "It doesn't matter
how beautiful your theory is."

74
00:09:36,325 --> 00:09:39,662
"If it doesn't agree
with experiment, it's wrong."

75
00:09:40,288 --> 00:09:42,498
I think that was Feynman. But yeah.

76
00:09:42,582 --> 00:09:45,334
According to the experiments,
all of our theories are wrong.

77
00:09:46,043 --> 00:09:47,086
All of them.

78
00:09:47,169 --> 00:09:50,047
All of the physics
of the past 60 years is wrong.

79
00:09:51,632 --> 00:09:53,217
Science is broken.

80
00:10:07,523 --> 00:10:08,983
You were just a baby.

81
00:10:11,902 --> 00:10:13,779
You're not throwing this away, are you?

82
00:10:14,488 --> 00:10:16,782
Oh, Saul. You mustn't.

83
00:10:17,408 --> 00:10:21,871
You still demonstrate great potential
for future scientific accomplishment.

84
00:10:21,954 --> 00:10:23,414
Missed my window.

85
00:10:23,497 --> 00:10:24,957
"A person who has not made

86
00:10:25,041 --> 00:10:28,669
his great contribution to science
before the age of 30 will never do so."

87
00:10:28,753 --> 00:10:30,379
How old are you? Thirty-one?

88
00:10:30,463 --> 00:10:31,464
Thirty-two.

89
00:10:32,590 --> 00:10:35,635
- Einstein wasn't right about everything.
- Hmm.

90
00:10:36,469 --> 00:10:39,138
If anyone can figure this out, it's you.

91
00:10:45,394 --> 00:10:46,979
- Saul.
- Yeah?

92
00:10:48,898 --> 00:10:50,524
Do you believe in God?

93
00:10:52,234 --> 00:10:53,778
Is that what it's come to?

94
00:10:59,241 --> 00:11:01,744
No. I don't.

95
00:11:03,454 --> 00:11:06,374
I accept that this defies
all known laws of physics,

96
00:11:06,457 --> 00:11:09,460
but... I don't think
that's an argument for God.

97
00:11:11,337 --> 00:11:12,963
So, what's left?

98
00:12:10,104 --> 00:12:13,482
<i>♪ I kissed a girl, and I liked it ♪</i>

99
00:12:13,566 --> 00:12:18,320

100

00:12:23,159 --> 00:12:25,953
- You know you're carrying me home, right?
- I've done it before.

102
00:12:26,036 --> 00:12:27,204

103
00:12:30,249 --> 00:12:31,375

<i>♪ I kissed a girl, and I liked it... ♪</i>

105
00:12:35,838 --> 00:12:38,257
It's possible our bar has gone to shit.

106
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:42,178
Second law of thermodynamics.
Eventually, everything turns to shit.

107
00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:45,848
Physics is turning to shit.
Bars can't be far behind.

108
00:12:45,931 --> 00:12:48,017
Explain to me what's going on.

109
00:12:49,143 --> 00:12:50,227
Okay...

110
00:12:50,311 --> 00:12:52,396
So, you ladies are gonna sing a song?

111
00:12:53,230 --> 00:12:55,107
- No.
- No? What do you mean, no?

112
00:12:55,191 --> 00:12:56,567
You're not... not singers?

113
00:12:56,650 --> 00:12:58,360
- No.
- All right.

114
00:12:58,444 --> 00:13:00,863
What do you do, then? Hmm?

115
00:13:00,946 --> 00:13:03,574
Wait. Hold on. Don't tell me.
Let me guess. You probably...

116
00:13:03,657 --> 00:13:06,786
I design self-assembling,
synthetic polymer nanofibers.

117
00:13:07,661 --> 00:13:09,830
I started a company that manufactures them

118
00:13:09,914 --> 00:13:13,667
for a variety of potential medical,
energy, and materials applications.

119
00:13:16,086 --> 00:13:16,921
And you?

120
00:13:17,004 --> 00:13:19,590
I'm a senior researcher
in the Theoretical Physics group

121
00:13:19,673 --> 00:13:20,716
at Imperial College.

122
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,718
I'm doing a metastudy
analyzing the results

123
00:13:22,802 --> 00:13:25,304
of particle accelerator experiments
around the world.

124
00:13:27,014 --> 00:13:29,058
Nice one. Yeah.

125
00:13:29,141 --> 00:13:31,644
- Rufus, you're up!
- Yeah, all right. That's me!

126
00:13:31,727 --> 00:13:33,687
Yeah, enjoy it. Bye.

127
00:13:37,024 --> 00:13:39,109
Okay, why is everyone freaking out?

128
00:13:40,569 --> 00:13:41,946
About a month ago,

129
00:13:42,029 --> 00:13:44,532
all the major accelerators
started generating results

130
00:13:44,615 --> 00:13:46,575
that make no fucking sense.

Mm.

143
00:14:23,654 --> 00:14:26,615
Saul sent that one
just last week from Oxford.

144
00:14:26,699 --> 00:14:30,077
It's been a while since Particle Physics,
but, I mean, this can't...

145
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:32,162
Nope. It can't.

146
00:14:32,997 --> 00:14:35,457
Well, then, maybe it's a hack.

147
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:37,543
In every accelerator on the planet?

148
00:14:38,335 --> 00:14:40,796
I went through the CERN code,
line by line. Nothing.

149
00:14:42,006 --> 00:14:45,217
The code for the centralized software?
How many lines is that?

150
00:14:45,301 --> 00:14:48,345
It's a lot, Auggie.
It's a lot of fucking lines.

151
00:14:49,221 --> 00:14:51,056
Okay, so it's a hardware issue.

152
00:14:51,599 --> 00:14:53,934
Dipole magnets,
muon chambers, calorimeters,

153
00:14:54,018 --> 00:14:58,314
every component checked four times over
in every collider from here to Beijing.

154
00:14:58,397 --> 00:15:00,316
Okay, so what does Saul say?

155
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:01,817
He says it's impossible.

156
00:15:03,193 --> 00:15:04,320
What about you?

157
00:15:04,403 --> 00:15:07,698
These experiments teach us
how the universe works.

158
00:15:07,781 --> 00:15:08,782
And that?

159
00:15:09,909 --> 00:15:12,536
That's fucking
<i>Alice in Wonderland.</i>

160
00:15:20,294 --> 00:15:21,295
Now he calls.

161
00:15:21,378 --> 00:15:24,058
I texted him to come three times,
and he wouldn't even text me back.

162
00:15:36,310 --> 00:15:37,937
See how you like it.

163
00:15:38,771 --> 00:15:41,106
You guys are like 14-year-olds.

164
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:47,112
Take it. He's probably high as fuck.

165
00:15:49,156 --> 00:15:50,532
It's fine. Take it.

166
00:15:52,993 --> 00:15:53,994
Hey.

167
00:16:05,673 --> 00:16:07,675
- Hey.
- Oh. Hey, hi.

168
00:16:08,217 --> 00:16:09,760
Do you see that?

169
00:16:12,012 --> 00:16:13,305
See what?

170
00:16:13,389 --> 00:16:15,599
- That.
- Huh?

171
00:16:19,687 --> 00:16:20,813
You all right, love?

172
00:16:39,039 --> 00:16:40,374
Auggie?

173
00:16:43,210 --> 00:16:45,212
Vera Ye just killed herself.

174
00:17:37,473 --> 00:17:39,099
Excited to see Jin?

175
00:17:39,183 --> 00:17:42,436
Well, it's not exactly
ideal circumstances, is it?

176
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:44,480
How long has it been?

177
00:17:44,563 --> 00:17:45,563
Don't know.

178
00:17:45,606 --> 00:17:48,650
I'll bet you do.
I bet you remember to the day.

179
00:17:51,028 --> 00:17:52,362
It's been a while.

180
00:17:53,822 --> 00:17:56,742
Fuck. I did not sleep at all last night.

181
00:17:56,825 --> 00:17:57,659
Why not?

182
00:17:59,161 --> 00:18:00,954
I don't know, Jack. Maybe it's, uh...

183
00:18:01,038 --> 00:18:03,332
Maybe it's because Vera's killed herself.

184
00:18:08,462 --> 00:18:09,546
To Vera.

185
00:18:18,055 --> 00:18:19,306
- Jesus.
- Hm?

186
00:18:22,726 --> 00:18:24,186
Hides the tequila smell.

187
00:18:24,269 --> 00:18:25,562
- Want one?
- No.

188
00:18:25,646 --> 00:18:27,356
- Have one.
- I don't want one.

189
00:18:27,439 --> 00:18:29,483
It's my most popular flavor.

190
00:18:29,566 --> 00:18:31,318
Third highest-selling crisps in the UK

191
00:18:31,401 --> 00:18:33,570
after Walkers Cheese and Onion
and Monster Munch Beef.

192
00:18:33,654 --> 00:18:35,906
- Congratulations.
- Mm-hmm. Suck a dick, Pringles.

193
00:18:41,954 --> 00:18:43,914
Have you heard
that Jin's got a new boyfriend?

194
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:47,626
Don't worry.

195
00:18:48,961 --> 00:18:50,838
I bet he's a total squid.

196
00:18:54,174 --> 00:18:55,175
You okay?

197
00:18:58,178 --> 00:18:59,680
Fuckin' Saul.

198
00:19:00,305 --> 00:19:01,390
Come say hi.

199
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:11,441
So sorry.

200
00:19:11,984 --> 00:19:13,026
Yeah. Me too.

201
00:19:15,028 --> 00:19:16,738
So, this is Prithviraj.

202
00:19:16,822 --> 00:19:17,656
Just Raj, mate.

203
00:19:17,739 --> 00:19:19,950
Nice to meet you.

204
00:19:20,826 --> 00:19:23,787
- What is goin' on here?
- I was trying to figure it out on YouTube.

205
00:19:23,871 --> 00:19:26,248
Winner of the Apker Award.
Can't tie a tie.

206
00:19:26,331 --> 00:19:29,960
Well, Lord Kelvin thought that
atoms were knotted vortices in the ether.

207
00:19:30,043 --> 00:19:32,588
- Ah, did he?
- He also thought that there are...

208
00:19:33,547 --> 00:19:34,798
Thank you.

209
00:19:34,882 --> 00:19:35,883
Is Auggie here yet?

210
00:19:35,966 --> 00:19:37,634
<i>She said she's running late.</i>

211
00:19:43,056 --> 00:19:46,643
<i>This service
is now approaching Oxford,</i>

212
00:19:46,727 --> 00:19:48,896
<i>where this train will terminate.</i>

213
00:19:48,979 --> 00:19:51,481
<i>Please make sure
you have all your belongings with you</i>

214
00:19:51,565 --> 00:19:53,483
<i>before you leave the train.</i>

215
00:20:31,146 --> 00:20:34,691
So sorry for your loss.
We all loved your daughter very much.

216
00:20:35,192 --> 00:20:36,693
Thank you for coming.

217
00:20:41,406 --> 00:20:43,367
You've all been so kind.

218
00:20:43,450 --> 00:20:44,868
Jin's looking good.

219
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:51,875
Phwoar. He's looking good as well.

220
00:20:54,670 --> 00:20:56,296
- What?
- Fuck off.

221
00:21:12,854 --> 00:21:13,939
Hey.

222
00:21:15,023 --> 00:21:17,067
How are you doing?

223
00:21:17,150 --> 00:21:18,902
Yeah, you know...

224
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:29,746
Hey.

225
00:21:36,837 --> 00:21:38,839
Did you see the neurologist?

226
00:21:38,922 --> 00:21:39,923
Yeah.

227
00:21:40,841 --> 00:21:41,883
What'd he say?

228
00:21:42,509 --> 00:21:44,928
<i>- She.</i>
- She. Oh. Jesus.

229
00:21:45,012 --> 00:21:46,430
She has no clue why it's happening.

230
00:21:47,180 --> 00:21:48,849
Well, still. It's still happening?

231
00:21:50,142 --> 00:21:52,060
Like, right now?

232
00:21:53,228 --> 00:21:55,272
Like, all the fucking time.

233
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:43,570
You drove, right?

234
00:23:38,041 --> 00:23:39,751
What does that even mean?

235
00:23:39,835 --> 00:23:42,963
"Do you believe in God?"
Strange question, don't you think?

236
00:23:43,046 --> 00:23:45,966
Yeah. Not as strange as jumping
into a Cherenkov tank, but sure.

237
00:23:46,049 --> 00:23:47,259
Was she acting weird, or...

238
00:23:47,342 --> 00:23:51,555
I don't know. Uh, yes?
But everything has been weird lately.

239
00:23:51,638 --> 00:23:54,325
That project was her baby.
When it was shut down, it was like...

240
00:23:54,349 --> 00:23:55,475
It was shut down?

241
00:23:55,559 --> 00:23:58,270
Can't justify using enough electricity
to power a small town

242
00:23:58,353 --> 00:24:00,188
when you're getting nonsense results.

243
00:24:00,272 --> 00:24:03,733
Yeah. Not just Oxford.
Every major accelerator on the planet.

244
00:24:03,817 --> 00:24:05,577
She must've been depressed
about that.

245
00:24:05,652 --> 00:24:07,012
Yeah. But to kill yourself?

246
00:24:07,070 --> 00:24:09,156
She was a bit of a killjoy,
if we're being honest.

247
00:24:09,239 --> 00:24:10,240
Don't be a dick, Jack.

248
00:24:10,323 --> 00:24:13,243
Ah. No. Listen to him.
You were her favorite.

249
00:24:13,326 --> 00:24:16,305
She'd have happily kept you on as
a research assistant till the end of time.

250
00:24:16,329 --> 00:24:17,622
But the rest of us, good luck.

251
00:24:17,706 --> 00:24:20,333
That's fucking rich,
considering you're the one who quit.

252
00:24:20,417 --> 00:24:23,545
And trust me,
all of you fucking noble academics,

253
00:24:23,628 --> 00:24:26,047
you'll be coming to me
and Auggie for loans in a few years.

254
00:24:26,131 --> 00:24:27,674
Oh, fuck off.

255
00:24:27,757 --> 00:24:30,385
Isn't that right, Auggie? When your...

256
00:24:30,469 --> 00:24:32,012
When your company goes public?

257
00:24:34,973 --> 00:24:36,600
Auggie!

258
00:24:36,683 --> 00:24:38,393
<i>♪ Nights I saw you... ♪</i>

259
00:24:38,477 --> 00:24:41,021
We're just saying that...
What did you call your company?

260
00:24:41,104 --> 00:24:43,064
Uh, the Nanotechnology Research Center.

261
00:24:43,148 --> 00:24:46,651
That's probably
the most boring name I've ever heard.

262
00:24:46,735 --> 00:24:49,196
Oh! Says the guy who named
his company "Jack's Snacks."

263
00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:50,864
- Yeah.
- Don't be a dick.

264
00:24:50,947 --> 00:24:52,699
Will, how's, uh... How's teaching going?

265
00:24:52,782 --> 00:24:55,744
Uh, I don't know.
Like, I have about, um...

266
00:24:55,827 --> 00:24:59,706
one kid in every class
who actually listens to what I'm saying.

267
00:24:59,789 --> 00:25:02,268
And the rest are just there
for their mandatory science course.

268
00:25:02,292 --> 00:25:03,960
- Oh.
- We were all that one kid.

269
00:25:04,044 --> 00:25:05,879
Yeah, that's true.

270
00:25:06,963 --> 00:25:08,673
Are you two fighting right now?

271
00:25:09,508 --> 00:25:11,092
Or fucking?

272
00:25:13,011 --> 00:25:14,179
Oh! Fighting <i>and</i> fucking.

273
00:25:14,262 --> 00:25:15,347
- Jack!
- Stop.

274
00:25:15,430 --> 00:25:17,557
Shut your mouth. You wanna know as well.

275
00:25:17,641 --> 00:25:20,036
Jack, I love you, but I swear,
if you don't shut the fuck up,

276
00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:22,103
I'm gonna punch a hole
straight through your head.

277
00:25:26,775 --> 00:25:28,235
I'm just gonna grab a cigarette.

278
00:25:48,046 --> 00:25:49,506
Oh shit.

279
00:25:55,303 --> 00:25:56,596
Need a little help?

280
00:26:06,398 --> 00:26:07,524
Thank you.

281
00:26:14,155 --> 00:26:15,657
May I?

282
00:26:17,117 --> 00:26:18,117
Hmm.

283
00:26:22,706 --> 00:26:23,873
It's a clear night.

284
00:26:25,333 --> 00:26:28,420
You can see the stars.

285
00:26:28,503 --> 00:26:31,256
Where I grew up,
you could see the stars every night.

286
00:26:34,926 --> 00:26:36,469
It's not easy, is it?

287
00:26:38,430 --> 00:26:40,849
Being a person in this fucked world.

288
00:26:42,517 --> 00:26:45,061
I understand what you're going through.

289
00:26:45,937 --> 00:26:47,022
I doubt it.

290
00:26:48,231 --> 00:26:50,025
It's not hopeless, though.

291
00:26:51,526 --> 00:26:53,445
Really.

292
00:26:53,945 --> 00:26:55,572
The Lord has a better way.

293
00:26:58,283 --> 00:27:01,286
Listen, you seem
like a very nice person.

294
00:27:01,369 --> 00:27:02,871
I'm just not interested, okay?

295
00:27:06,374 --> 00:27:07,584
How far has it got?

296
00:27:11,212 --> 00:27:12,631
Your countdown?

297
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:19,554
How much time do you have left?

298
00:27:19,638 --> 00:27:21,598
Less than two days?

299
00:27:22,307 --> 00:27:23,307
Yeah?

300
00:27:24,059 --> 00:27:25,060
That's not much.

301
00:27:26,436 --> 00:27:28,563
It's easy to make it stop.

302
00:27:29,689 --> 00:27:31,524
You put an end to your work.

303
00:27:32,567 --> 00:27:34,027
No more nanofibers.

304
00:27:34,110 --> 00:27:35,862
You shut down the lab.

305
00:27:35,945 --> 00:27:37,030
Simple.

306
00:27:39,199 --> 00:27:41,576
- Who are you?
- I'd be suspicious as well.

307
00:27:42,077 --> 00:27:43,161
Tell you what.

308
00:27:45,497 --> 00:27:48,041
Tomorrow, at midnight,

309
00:27:48,708 --> 00:27:50,543
at exactly midnight,

310
00:27:51,795 --> 00:27:54,839
go outside and look up at the sky.

311
00:27:57,133 --> 00:27:59,761
Has the universe ever winked at you?

312
00:28:05,809 --> 00:28:07,644
Tomorrow at midnight.

313
00:28:12,232 --> 00:28:14,234
You don't want it to get to zero.

314
00:28:16,444 --> 00:28:18,780
Nothing good ever happens at zero.

315
00:28:23,576 --> 00:28:24,577
Hey!

316
00:30:01,674 --> 00:30:04,844
How old?

317
00:30:09,307 --> 00:30:13,061
Between three and four hundred, I assume.

318
00:30:14,813 --> 00:30:18,191
That tree saw the Ming emperors.

319
00:30:24,906 --> 00:30:31,162
You must have considered
the consequences of all this destruction.

320
00:30:34,666 --> 00:30:37,752
These thoughts are dangerous.

321
00:30:37,836 --> 00:30:42,632
I have nothing to say
to the <i>Great Production News.</i>

322
00:30:42,715 --> 00:30:44,843
I'm not asking on behalf of the paper.

323
00:30:44,926 --> 00:30:46,302
I'm just Bai Mulin,

324
00:30:46,386 --> 00:30:48,513
fellow comrade.

325
00:30:53,309 --> 00:30:57,689
I've climbed up there. No one knows
what goes on behind those gates.

326
00:30:57,981 --> 00:31:00,692
Things get odder the closer you get.

327
00:31:00,775 --> 00:31:03,820
The soldiers working there
have lost their hair.

328
00:31:03,903 --> 00:31:06,281
Clear weather turns stormy.

329
00:31:06,364 --> 00:31:09,951
The animals make strange sounds.

330
00:31:14,873 --> 00:31:18,126
You read English, don't you?

331
00:31:27,093 --> 00:31:28,177
<i>Silent Spring.</i>

332
00:31:30,889 --> 00:31:32,849
This book was very influential
in the West.

333
00:31:32,932 --> 00:31:36,311
It's about how people
are poisoning the world.

334
00:31:36,394 --> 00:31:42,567
It's like reading into the future
if we persist with this destruction.

335
00:31:54,913 --> 00:32:01,628
"Here again, we are reminded
that in nature, nothing exists alone."

336
00:32:05,590 --> 00:32:08,301
Keep it for now if you want to read it.

337
00:32:08,384 --> 00:32:10,553
But be careful.

338
00:32:10,637 --> 00:32:13,264
Don't let anyone see.

339
00:34:44,582 --> 00:34:46,292
Commander Song. Forgive me.

340
00:34:46,375 --> 00:34:49,670
I didn't see where I was going.

341
00:34:58,179 --> 00:35:00,223
Have you lost this?

342
00:35:01,432 --> 00:35:03,643
How did you get this toxic propaganda?

343
00:35:03,726 --> 00:35:04,811
It isn't mine.

344
00:35:04,894 --> 00:35:06,771
It's in English.

345
00:35:06,854 --> 00:35:09,649
You speak English. Who else's could it be?

346
00:35:12,318 --> 00:35:16,197
A truthful response
is in your best interest.

347
00:35:18,783 --> 00:35:19,992
I forget.

348
00:35:20,868 --> 00:35:22,620
You will pay the price

349
00:35:22,703 --> 00:35:24,705
if you are protecting someone.

350
00:35:24,789 --> 00:35:28,084
Someone must have given it to you!

351
00:35:31,420 --> 00:35:34,215
Take her to Division Headquarters.

352
00:35:53,609 --> 00:35:57,572
I am Teng Lihua
of the Intermediate People's Court.

353
00:35:58,447 --> 00:36:01,367
How long have they made you wait?

354
00:36:08,833 --> 00:36:09,959
Boy.

355
00:36:10,042 --> 00:36:12,128
How long has this stove been out?

356
00:36:12,211 --> 00:36:16,048
Little Wenjie will freeze to death!
Fetch some coal.

357
00:36:21,095 --> 00:36:23,764
I asked to see you. Do you know why?

358
00:36:25,266 --> 00:36:29,520
Because not only are you the daughter
of the disgraced Ye Zhetai,

359
00:36:29,604 --> 00:36:32,106
but his star pupil as well.

360
00:36:32,190 --> 00:36:34,609
In the eyes of many in the Party,

361
00:36:34,692 --> 00:36:38,321
this makes you irredeemable.

362
00:36:40,531 --> 00:36:42,408
But I don't see it that way.

363
00:36:42,491 --> 00:36:46,120
I know of your own accomplishments
as a scholar.

364
00:36:46,204 --> 00:36:48,581
I don't want your talent to go to waste.

365
00:36:51,876 --> 00:36:57,381
All you need to do is sign this paper,
take a political class,

366
00:36:57,465 --> 00:37:01,135
and you'll be approved
to rejoin the Construction Corps.

367
00:37:01,761 --> 00:37:03,512
I'd like to read it, please.

368
00:37:06,224 --> 00:37:08,601
You can trust me on this.

369
00:37:08,684 --> 00:37:12,939
This document has nothing to do
with the Imperialist book.

370
00:37:30,581 --> 00:37:32,833
My father is dead.

371
00:37:33,084 --> 00:37:35,670
But there are others in his field

372
00:37:35,753 --> 00:37:37,880
still spreading dangerous ideas.

373
00:37:38,631 --> 00:37:40,549
We lack evidence against them.

374
00:37:40,883 --> 00:37:44,136
I've never seen my father
with any of these people.

375
00:37:44,679 --> 00:37:46,639
The statements are all true.

376
00:37:46,722 --> 00:37:49,934
Even your mother has signed.

377
00:37:50,476 --> 00:37:53,604
See.

378
00:37:55,314 --> 00:37:57,066
I cannot sign this.

379
00:37:58,276 --> 00:38:00,027
I cannot testify.

380
00:38:00,319 --> 00:38:02,238
If you fail to sign,

381
00:38:02,321 --> 00:38:05,283
the Military Control Commission
will prosecute you.

382
00:38:05,533 --> 00:38:06,909
At that stage,

383
00:38:07,493 --> 00:38:10,204
I will be powerless to help.

384
00:38:16,585 --> 00:38:19,714
I cannot sign this.

385
00:38:19,797 --> 00:38:22,383
I cannot testify.

386
00:38:47,325 --> 00:38:50,661
Stubborn little bitch.

387
00:40:06,070 --> 00:40:06,946
Ye Wenjie.

388
00:40:07,029 --> 00:40:09,365
I am Lei Zhicheng,
Political Commissar of Red Coast Base.

389
00:40:09,448 --> 00:40:13,119
This is Yang Weining,
Chief Engineer of Red Coast Base.

390
00:40:13,202 --> 00:40:18,999
Ye Wenjie, you are credited
as the author of this article.

391
00:40:19,083 --> 00:40:20,459
Yes.

392
00:40:23,796 --> 00:40:25,923
"The Possible Extenses of..."

393
00:40:26,006 --> 00:40:28,217
"The Possible Existence
of Phase Boundaries

394
00:40:28,300 --> 00:40:32,513
within the Solar Radiation Zone
and Their Reflective Characteristics."

395
00:40:33,097 --> 00:40:34,932
Yes. I wrote it.

396
00:40:35,015 --> 00:40:37,685
We have a need for your specific talents.

397
00:40:37,768 --> 00:40:41,897
The Commission has decided
to give you a chance.

398
00:40:41,981 --> 00:40:44,984
Rehabilitate yourself here
rather than prison.

399
00:40:45,067 --> 00:40:46,944
This is a military base.

400
00:40:47,027 --> 00:40:49,530
The research here
is of the highest security classification.

401
00:40:49,613 --> 00:40:51,532
And given your status,

402
00:40:51,615 --> 00:40:53,868
if you stay,

403
00:40:53,951 --> 00:40:56,036
you will never leave.

404
00:40:57,163 --> 00:40:58,998
I want to go in.

405
00:41:01,876 --> 00:41:04,795
I will stay here for the rest of my life.

406
00:41:53,427 --> 00:41:54,427
Yep.

407
00:41:54,470 --> 00:41:58,182
<i>- Any progress?</i>
- More than you think. Less than you want.

408
00:41:58,682 --> 00:42:00,976
<i>Anything happening with the Oxford five?</i>

409
00:42:01,060 --> 00:42:04,522
Maybe. Some strange CCTV footage

410
00:42:04,605 --> 00:42:07,066
{\an8}on Salazar the night of Vera Ye's funeral.

411
00:42:07,942 --> 00:42:08,943
<i>What about Evans?</i>

412
00:42:09,652 --> 00:42:13,364
Rarely seen
in public since 1984.

413
00:42:13,447 --> 00:42:16,200
Next to nothing written about him
for 42 years

414
00:42:16,283 --> 00:42:18,327
since he took over daddy's oil company.

415
00:42:18,410 --> 00:42:20,287
<i>Where'd he go in that helicopter?</i>

416
00:42:20,371 --> 00:42:23,749
{\an8}We lost him over the Atlantic.
Satellite malfunction.

417
00:42:24,625 --> 00:42:26,669
{\an8}<i>My satellites don't malfunction.</i>

418
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:31,006
{\an8}<i>All right. Now,
what about that thing in Tehran?</i>

419
00:42:31,090 --> 00:42:32,591
<i>The shiny bicycle helmet?</i>

420
00:42:33,217 --> 00:42:35,844
Whatever it is,
we can't get our hands on it.

421
00:42:35,928 --> 00:42:37,972
<i>Are we sure it was another suicide?</i>

422
00:42:38,055 --> 00:42:39,223
I wouldn't say "sure."

423
00:42:39,932 --> 00:42:43,310
<i>The Iranians have been
less than completely helpful.</i>

424
00:42:43,394 --> 00:42:48,857
Clarence, you've been fired
from Scotland Yard, MI5, and OSCT.

425
00:42:48,941 --> 00:42:50,526
<i>That must be some kind of record.</i>

426
00:42:50,609 --> 00:42:52,778
I've got a knack for failing upwards.

427
00:42:52,861 --> 00:42:54,613
<i>You don't fail any higher than this.</i>

428
00:42:54,697 --> 00:42:56,448
<i>This is your last-chance saloon.</i>

429
00:42:57,116 --> 00:42:58,325
<i>Don't fuck it up.</i>

430
00:43:00,619 --> 00:43:01,662
<i>No smoking in here.</i>

431
00:43:33,319 --> 00:43:36,280
Take it. She would want you to have it.

432
00:43:42,620 --> 00:43:44,038
I don't understand it.

433
00:43:46,373 --> 00:43:47,416
I've tried.

434
00:43:48,626 --> 00:43:53,380
But I just can't wrap my head around it,
why she would do that.

435
00:43:55,049 --> 00:43:56,050
That wasn't Vera.

436
00:43:57,134 --> 00:44:00,012
Her work... Things weren't going well.

437
00:44:00,929 --> 00:44:03,807
I know. It's the same for all of us.

438
00:44:05,434 --> 00:44:10,606
I'm sorry to ask, but did she leave
a note or any explanation?

439
00:44:11,690 --> 00:44:12,691
Nothing.

440
00:44:19,239 --> 00:44:21,158
She asked Saul about God.

441
00:44:21,742 --> 00:44:22,868
Did she ever ask you?

442
00:44:22,951 --> 00:44:24,370
About God?

443
00:44:26,372 --> 00:44:29,750
We're not believers in this house.
We're scientists.

444
00:44:30,250 --> 00:44:32,503
Did she say anything strange to you?

445
00:44:33,295 --> 00:44:35,422
Did she do anything strange?

446
00:44:40,135 --> 00:44:41,512
Video games.

447
00:44:42,221 --> 00:44:44,515
- She was playing a video game.
- Vera?

448
00:44:44,598 --> 00:44:46,558
Yes, quite a lot.

449
00:44:46,642 --> 00:44:47,559
Hmm.

450
00:44:47,643 --> 00:44:49,144
Where is it?

451
00:44:50,729 --> 00:44:51,729
Oh.

452
00:44:57,569 --> 00:44:59,071
That's a video game?

453
00:45:00,197 --> 00:45:01,407
Where's the rest of it?

454
00:45:02,533 --> 00:45:03,701
That's it.

455
00:45:07,204 --> 00:45:09,289
What kind of game is this?

456
00:45:09,373 --> 00:45:11,625
I don't know.

457
00:45:12,584 --> 00:45:14,002
I played <i>Pong.</i>

458
00:45:18,590 --> 00:45:19,466
Can I have it?

459
00:45:19,550 --> 00:45:20,884
Of course.

460
00:45:26,306 --> 00:45:27,558
Is that you?

461
00:45:30,060 --> 00:45:33,105
In another life. My first job.

462
00:45:33,897 --> 00:45:35,149
You're beautiful.

463
00:45:36,191 --> 00:45:37,276
I was.

464
00:45:38,610 --> 00:45:40,404
Time is a motherfucker.

465
00:46:01,508 --> 00:46:02,948
Only three months,

466
00:46:03,010 --> 00:46:04,470
and you get to see your first test.

467
00:46:04,553 --> 00:46:06,680
You're lucky.

468
00:46:06,764 --> 00:46:09,683
Most people have to wait longer.

469
00:46:09,767 --> 00:46:11,018
What are we testing?

470
00:46:11,101 --> 00:46:12,811
Missiles?

471
00:46:13,270 --> 00:46:15,981
Everybody has missiles.

472
00:46:16,064 --> 00:46:21,945
<i>Target Coordinates: BN20197F,</i>

473
00:46:22,029 --> 00:46:23,280
<i>checked and confirmed.</i>

474
00:46:23,697 --> 00:46:25,365
<i>Test transmission in ten.</i>

475
00:46:25,449 --> 00:46:26,283
<i>Nine.</i>

476
00:46:26,408 --> 00:46:27,408
<i>Eight.</i>

477
00:46:27,493 --> 00:46:28,327
<i>Seven.</i>

478
00:46:28,410 --> 00:46:29,410
<i>Six.</i>

479
00:46:29,453 --> 00:46:30,329
<i>Five.</i>

480
00:46:30,412 --> 00:46:31,288
<i>Four.</i>

481
00:46:31,371 --> 00:46:32,371
<i>Three.</i>

482
00:46:32,414 --> 00:46:33,332
<i>Two.</i>

483
00:46:33,415 --> 00:46:34,415
<i>One.</i>

484
00:46:34,583 --> 00:46:35,876
<i>Begin transmission.</i>

485
00:47:11,620 --> 00:47:13,497
<i>Transmission complete.</i>

486
00:47:14,122 --> 00:47:16,166
BN20197F.

487
00:47:20,212 --> 00:47:22,381
Those were the coordinates for the target.

488
00:47:22,464 --> 00:47:25,133
You have a good memory.

489
00:47:26,385 --> 00:47:29,471
What is the target?

490
00:48:16,560 --> 00:48:17,769
<i>Level one.</i>

491
00:49:23,669 --> 00:49:24,795
What the fuck?

492
00:49:28,256 --> 00:49:30,717
Wade really wants
one of these helmets.

493
00:49:30,801 --> 00:49:32,719
Thinks they're highly relevant.

494
00:49:33,720 --> 00:49:35,514
We ever seen one over here?

495
00:49:35,597 --> 00:49:37,140
No, not yet.

496
00:49:38,433 --> 00:49:39,643
What else is relevant?

497
00:49:39,726 --> 00:49:41,019
Mike Evans.

498
00:49:41,103 --> 00:49:43,939
That bicycle helmet looks expensive.

499
00:49:44,022 --> 00:49:45,399
Evans is rich.

500
00:49:45,482 --> 00:49:46,692
What about the countdowns?

501
00:49:46,775 --> 00:49:48,777
Yes, if they happen to scientists.

502
00:49:48,860 --> 00:49:51,321
Suicides, if they happen to scientists.

503
00:49:51,405 --> 00:49:54,157
Anything strange happening
to scientists is relevant.

504
00:49:54,241 --> 00:49:57,869
Anyone connected to anything strange
happening to scientists is relevant.

505
00:49:57,953 --> 00:50:00,038
- Who decides what's relevant?
- Wade.

506
00:50:00,122 --> 00:50:02,624
- Who decides he decides?
- Governments.

507
00:50:02,708 --> 00:50:04,126
- Which ones?
- Most.

508
00:50:04,209 --> 00:50:07,713
They're not too keen on
the notion of science being broken.

509
00:50:07,796 --> 00:50:10,882
I don't really understand
the science that's broken, to be honest.

510
00:50:10,966 --> 00:50:14,052
I don't understand it either,
but it's not good.

511
00:50:17,347 --> 00:50:19,808
Just be glad you're not a scientist.

512
00:50:19,891 --> 00:50:22,352
Shit time to be a scientist.

513
00:50:24,438 --> 00:50:27,274
You're smoking a lot of weed.

514
00:50:27,357 --> 00:50:29,609
Yep. Is that why we're here?
This an intervention?

515
00:50:29,693 --> 00:50:30,693
No.

516
00:50:31,111 --> 00:50:33,822
- Well, what are we doing here?
- Not what you're thinking.

517
00:50:33,905 --> 00:50:36,300
- I don't think anything.
- Yeah, you are. And it's not that.

518
00:50:36,324 --> 00:50:38,994
You asked me to come, here I am,

519
00:50:40,162 --> 00:50:44,291
on this moonless night,
in this beautiful place.

520
00:50:45,208 --> 00:50:48,587
You with all those curves
and me with no brakes.

521
00:51:04,061 --> 00:51:06,772
What did
that weird chick say to you again?

522
00:51:06,855 --> 00:51:08,982
"Has the universe ever winked at you?"

523
00:51:10,192 --> 00:51:13,111
She said to look at the sky at midnight
and gave me this.

524
00:51:16,323 --> 00:51:18,950
It came out of
a breakfast cereal. I looked it up.

525
00:51:19,618 --> 00:51:21,495
They haven't made it since 1963.

526
00:51:23,580 --> 00:51:26,374
- What's going on with you, though?
- I don't want you to know.

527
00:51:27,375 --> 00:51:28,460
No confirmation bias.

528
00:51:28,543 --> 00:51:32,089
Just watch, and let me know what
you observe, if you observe anything.

529
00:51:32,172 --> 00:51:35,801
Science, dude.
That's why you're here, okay?

530
00:51:35,884 --> 00:51:38,512
I understand my role.

531
00:51:40,555 --> 00:51:42,182
Thank you for being here.

532
00:51:50,023 --> 00:51:52,734
It looks like Morse code,
but it's not.

533
00:51:52,818 --> 00:51:55,487
- You know Morse code?
- I know all kind of shit.

534
00:51:57,405 --> 00:51:59,282
Toasty-O-Sters.

535
00:51:59,950 --> 00:52:02,953
I mean, it's not a very good name.
I could think of a better name.

536
00:52:03,036 --> 00:52:04,704
I'd have to taste it first.

537
00:52:04,788 --> 00:52:08,458
The name should reflect and support
what it feels like to eat the cereal.

538
00:52:08,542 --> 00:52:11,002
It's toasted. Like, we know that much...

539
00:52:11,086 --> 00:52:12,796
Shut up and observe.

540
00:52:15,882 --> 00:52:17,717
Two minutes to midnight.

541
00:52:23,890 --> 00:52:24,891
Sit.

542
00:52:35,402 --> 00:52:39,156
Not everyone here agrees
with what is about to be done.

543
00:52:39,239 --> 00:52:42,159
Given your political status.

544
00:52:42,242 --> 00:52:46,913
On Chief Engineer Yang's recommendation,

545
00:52:46,997 --> 00:52:49,082
we have decided

546
00:52:49,166 --> 00:52:54,588
to inform you of the true nature
of the Red Coast Project.

547
00:52:55,797 --> 00:52:58,466
Stars are so bright tonight.

548
00:52:58,550 --> 00:52:59,593
You're so high.

549
00:53:00,510 --> 00:53:03,138
Yeah, but still,

550
00:53:04,472 --> 00:53:05,807
they're pretty bright.

551
00:53:11,813 --> 00:53:12,814
Saul.

552
00:53:20,030 --> 00:53:21,114
Oh my God.

553
00:53:21,990 --> 00:53:26,745
Red Coast is not
an experimental weapons program.

554
00:53:33,376 --> 00:53:34,376
Go on.

555
00:53:35,629 --> 00:53:39,925
The emissions from the system
are modulated.

556
00:53:40,008 --> 00:53:43,595
Frequency modulation is not necessary
for weapons systems.

557
00:53:45,305 --> 00:53:47,015
You are correct.

558
00:53:47,098 --> 00:53:50,310
It is not necessary for weaponization.

559
00:53:50,393 --> 00:53:54,731
But it is necessary for communication.

560
00:54:11,790 --> 00:54:13,875
I observe the universe winking.

561
00:54:13,959 --> 00:54:15,502
How can it be happening?

562
00:54:15,585 --> 00:54:16,585
It can't.

563
00:54:30,976 --> 00:54:32,227
Shit. It's a code.

564
00:54:33,395 --> 00:54:34,562
What?

565
00:54:35,814 --> 00:54:37,232
What does it say?

566
00:54:38,316 --> 00:54:39,317
What does it say?

567
00:54:39,776 --> 00:54:41,528
Communication...

568
00:54:42,445 --> 00:54:43,445
with whom?

569
00:54:47,534 --> 00:54:50,787
With whomever is out there.

570
00:54:53,999 --> 00:54:55,667
What is that?

571
00:54:55,750 --> 00:54:59,629
That, Clarence, is our enemy.

572
00:55:00,755 --> 00:55:03,550
It's not letters. It's just numbers.

573
00:55:03,633 --> 00:55:04,884
Which numbers?

574
00:55:05,635 --> 00:55:09,264
Ten, thirty-four, zero, six,

575
00:55:09,347 --> 00:55:13,518
five, four, three,

576
00:55:14,311 --> 00:55:16,354
two, one.

577
00:55:27,365 --> 00:55:29,993
<i>Don't you want to know
why the stars flickered for you?</i>

578
00:55:32,412 --> 00:55:34,914
<i>This is what Vera was playing
before she killed herself.</i>

579
00:55:37,208 --> 00:55:41,171
<i>Your mission is to solve
the riddle of this world.</i>

580
00:55:43,048 --> 00:55:44,924
<i>If one of us survives,</i>

581
00:55:46,051 --> 00:55:47,385
<i>we all survive.</i>

582
00:55:55,393 --> 00:55:57,395
<i>There's someone behind everything.</i>

583
00:55:58,146 --> 00:55:59,146
<i>You just have to dig.</i>

584
00:56:04,652 --> 00:56:07,155
My Lord, we can help you.

585
00:56:18,291 --> 00:56:19,709
<i>I think they're real.</i>

586
00:56:20,210 --> 00:56:21,252
<i>And they're coming.</i>
