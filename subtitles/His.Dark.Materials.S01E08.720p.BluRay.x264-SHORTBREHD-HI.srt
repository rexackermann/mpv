But Grumman never married,
never had a son.

another question, or...

I should get you to do anything.

The truth is, I don't know.

244
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:06,877
Why is the Magisterium so afraid of it?

245
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:11,438
They're afraid of it
because they think it is sin.

246

Actual physical sin.

247
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:17,473
Raining down from the sky,
settling on humanity

248
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:20,832
and infecting our souls with evil.

249
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:22,758
To be fair, it's a terrifying thought.

250

For the longest time,
the Magisterium completely ignored Dust.

But then it was discovered

252
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:34,155
that Dust only begins to settle
on humans going through puberty.

253
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:36,351
The connection was made to Adam and Eve...

254
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:40,599
...and they labelled Dust as original sin.

255
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:42,760
Original sin?

256
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:47,192

like the serpent told her to.

00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:51,795
Well done.

259
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:53,513
And the serpent said,

260
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:55,472
"You shall not surely die,

270

271
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:35,880
